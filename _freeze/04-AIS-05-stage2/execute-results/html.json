You will still write about **one** of the two project options on sustainability or belonging that you developed in the stage 1 report as a group.\n\n- The deadline is **December 12th 2025**.\n\n- This assessment is worth 50% of your final course grade. \n\n- You will combine all the research and data skills you have developed in the course to produce a reproducible research report. You will submit **three** files to allow the marker to check both the reproducibility of your work alongside marking the content:\n\n    1. The .Rmd file using the stage 2 template we provide to include the title page, abstract, results, discussion, references, and appendices. We will use this file and the data you provide to check your file knits. \n\n    2. A knitted Word document created from the .Rmd file. Given we only have so much time in the course for you to learn about formatting in Markdown, you can edit the formatting of the Word document to make sure your work is consistent with APA 7th edition. This is the file we will mark and add feedback to. \n    \n    3. The data as a .csv file for the project you worked on. We will use this and the .Rmd file you provide to check your document knits. \n\n- The submission link will open at least one week prior to the deadline and will be in the **Assessment: Stage 1 Group and Stage 2 Individual Reports** section of Moodle. Remember you must upload all three files. \n\n## Word count and formatting\n\n- The maximum word count for the knitted Word document component of the stage 2 report is **1500** words. \n\n- This includes all text within the abstract, results, and discussion sections including in-text citations. However, it does not include the references or any appendix items.\n\n - Please note that there is no 10% rule, **1500** words is a strict upper limit.\n\n- Your work should be presented in a professional sans-serif font, e.g. Arial or Calibri, 12-point font, double-spaced with 1-inch (2.54cm) margins.\n\n - All citations and references should follow APA 7th edition guidelines.\n\n## Type of assessment/structure\n\n- The stage 2 individual report is modeled on the second half of a [registered report](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports). When a research team has their stage 1 submission approved, they go out and collect data, then write up their results and discussion. You are working with secondary data all the groups contribute to, so you did not create or design a study yourself, but you are putting your stage 1 plan in action and justifying any deviations from your plan.  \n\n- The knitted Word document component of your stage 2 individual report will include an abstract, results, and discussion section. You will also have a reference list and any appendix items beyond the generative AI declaration. You will receive a .Rmd template outlining the key sections as part of the course. \n\n## Assessment Criteria\n\nYour stage 2 individual report will be assessed on the three University of Glasgow Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) which we split into the following assessment criteria, in addition to a separate item on reproducibility: \n\n**Quality of the Knowledge and Research**\n\n- Demonstrate technical knowledge by correctly reporting and interpreting the results.\n\n- Demonstrate theoretical knowledge by providing a detailed evidence-based understanding of the topic of the report.\n\n**Quality of the Evaluation**\n\n- Use and show academic evidence to support all arguments and discussion.\n\n- Evaluate your study and how your results fit into the wider literature.\n\n**Quality of the Academic Communication**\n\n- Write clearly and succinctly with appropriate use of paragraphs, spelling, and grammar.\n\n- Reference all sources and report all information in line with APA guidelines.\n\n- Ensure that all parts of the report have a logical structure, e.g., the results should present descriptive statistics before inferential statistics, and the discussion should follow a narrow-to-broad scope.\n\n**Reproducibility**\n\n- Provide a reproducible document that can be knitted without any errors.\n\n## Assessment support\n\n- Guidance on how to write a psychology report and how to do APA referencing form part of the weekly course activities. You should consult the resources provided throughout the course to help you write your stage two report.\n\n- The Fundamentals of Quantitative Methods book covers writing reproducible documents and your experience from the data skills assessments will help work reproducibly. \n\n - Further information about assessment criteria and feedback is available in the [Feedback Information Sheet section](#stage2-FIS).\n\n- Additional writing and study advice, including 1-to-1 guidance is available via the [Student Learning Development (SLD) website](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/sld/).\n\n## How to do well in this assessment\n\n- Meet each of the assessment criteria; use these as a checklist when you are writing and editing your work.\n\n- Allow time to proof-read your work before submission.\n\n- Read peer-reviewed journal articles (preferably registered reports to see the specific approach) as these will help guide your tone and help you develop your academic writing. Remember that you can read anything for content and style. These are different mindsets when reading so go into your reading with a given purpose  - what do I want to get from this paper? - and that will help use your time more efficiently.\n\n- Write clearly, concisely, with a professional academic tone and logical structure.\n\n- Avoid using quotations. Rephrasing the writing in your own words and with appropriate citation is much more effective in conveying information.\n\n- Concisely and accurately report and interpret descriptive statistics, diagnostic checks for assumptions, and inferential statistics. Note and justify any deviations from the stage 1 report.\n\n- Present appropriate visualisations for the analyses that you conduct. \n\n- Interpret the results of the project in the context of the wider literature.\n\n- Demonstrate evidence of evaluation, both of the wider literature and of the current project.\n\n- Provide a concise conclusion and an overall summary that covers each section of the report in the form of an abstract.\n\n- Adhere to APA 7th edition conventions for referencing, formatting, and the reporting of results.\n\n## Common mistakes\n\n- Writing that contains grammatical errors, a lack of clarity, or an informal tone. Reading published articles in comparison to scientific blogs or newspapers will greatly help get the correct tone. The key is to focus on how they are writing and phrasing differently across different media.\n\n- Missing detail and/or unnecessary detail in the result sections.\n\n- Failure to report the results of statistical tests according to APA convention.\n\n- Failure to provide necessary visualisations or the inclusion of unnecessary visualisations. You do not need to provide visualisations for any diagnostic checks in the main report (although you should include these in the appendix).\n\n- A lack of evaluation of the wider literature and the current project and/or a discussion of the limitations that is not supported by evidence. \n\n- Failure to adhere to the word limit. Part of the skill development is writing concisely.\n\n- Not considering reproducibility and including features like absolute file paths which will not work on someone else's computer. \n\n## How is the assessment related to the lectures for this course?\n\n- The stage 2 report assesses your ability to apply the concepts that you have learned about during the lectures. This includes methodology and research design, statistics, communicating research, and reproducible research practices. \n\n- Depending on the topic you chose in your group, the project may also be related to content from other courses such as social psychology or human development. \n\n## Why am I being assessed like this?\n\n- Registered reports are increasingly common in psychological research and it is a process that will serve you well should you continue with research as it demonstrates a commitment to open and reproducible science.\n\n- By providing your work as a reproducible report, you demonstrate open and reproducible research skills. Learning how to use R/RStudio is a big investment, so by assessing reproducibility you will receive feedback on both your coding and the content of your report.\n\n- The stage 2 report allows you to address your research question using your planned methods and analyses from the stage 1 report. You will then put your findings in context and explore how your results were either consistent or inconsistent with past research, while noting any important limitations in your methods. \n\n- The stage 2 report will help you with your qualitative RM2 report, dissertation, and with any other written research-focused work you may conduct in the future.\n\n## How does this relate to previous work I have completed?\n\n- You can gain informal feedback by talking to your lab tutor, by attending student office hours, by asking questions on Teams, and by discussing papers you have read with peers and/or staff. \n\n- Feedback from your stage 1 group report may help you with justifying any deviations from your data analysis plan, in your discussion to identify limitations, and your use of technical terminology.\n\n- Feedback on your two data skills assignments will help develop your reproducible research skills. \n\n- Feedback on any written assignment will help with academic communication. \n\n## Academic Integrity\n\nPlease note that when submitting your work for assessment we accept it on the understanding that it is your own effort and work and unique to the set assignment.\n\nTo support you in understanding what plagiarism is and in avoiding it, please read the following resources that the University provides:\n\n- [SRC Advice and Support](https://www.glasgowunisrc.org/advice/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n- [Code of Student Conduct](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/apg/policies/uniregs/regulations2024-25/feesandgeneral/studentsupportandconductmatters/reg33/){target=\"_blank\"} and [Plagiarism Statement](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/apg/policies/uniregs/regulations2024-25/feesandgeneral/studentsupportandconductmatters/reg32/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n- [Avoiding plagiarism and engage in good academic practice](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/enrol/index.php?id=13038){target=\"_blank\"} (a Moodle course you can self-enrol in).\n\n- [Student support for AI, plagiarism, and digital skills ](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/sld/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n**Statement on groupwork**: This report is not a group work assignment, so your work must be your own individual contribution. However, as you worked closely in a small team and from common templates, we know that there may be some unavoidable similarities between team members in the results, but it should never be identical or close to identical.\n\n## AI statement\n\nThe University of Glasgow recognises the value of generative artificial intelligence tools in academic and professional workplaces. The university has a responsibility to ensure that students acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and other competencies associated within their discipline. The [Student Learning Development](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/sld/ai/students/){target=\"_blank\"} service provides general guidance and support for students on the use of generative AI, but each item of assessment in your courses will have specific generative AI guidance about use and misuse in place. Where generative AI restrictions are in place, they have been carefully designed to maximise your learning opportunity whilst discouraging reliance on generative AI in a way that undermines your learning, or development of good professional practice and graduate attributes.\n\n**Statement on use of generative AI**: The current assessment is summative, meaning that it contributes to your course grade. The generative AI use for this assessment is categorised as **amber** and use of generative AI is allowed for some tasks during the preparation of the assessment.\n\nThere is no expectation that you will use generative AI and we have no evidence that its use will confer an advantage for this assessment. If you do use generative AI, please clearly acknowledge its use in-text via citations and referencing and in an appendix with a declaration of AI use as appropriate – please see the title page on Moodle for further instructions. If you choose to use it, we recommend that you use the Microsoft Edge browser with Copilot and sign into your university account using the two-factor authentication to ensure that your work is private and secure. Please keep a log of all AI use.\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to work on your quantitative research methods skills and your understanding of a research project from communicating your findings to putting your results in context. The stage two report is the culmination of your skill development in RM1, as you are applying your data wrangling, visualisation, and analysis skills, plus your subject knowledge and research skills for writing the results and discussion. You will write whole reports in RM2 and your dissertation, so this is the chance to develop your own skills. Any short-cuts you take now will have a knock-on effect in future. So, try and embrace the skill development component to the course and assessment. \n\nIf you do use generative AI tools, we recommend using it for the following (non-exhaustive) kind of tasks: \n\n- Clarify complex concepts and reinforce understanding around intended learning outcomes.\n\n- Plan a structure for your assessment.\n\n- Recommend keywords and other tips for effective literature searches.\n\n- Help debug code by working out the source of errors. \n\n- Assist with referencing format.\n\nIf you do use generative AI tools, we strongly recommend **not** using it for the following (non-exhaustive) kind of tasks: \n\n- Conducting your whole literature review for you, as you may miss out on potentially useful sources and AI tools are notorious for making up references.\n\n- Write whole paragraphs or sections of your report for you. \n\n- Conduct your whole data analysis or generate summaries of data for you. \n\n- Rewrite bulleted lists or notes into sentences and paragraphs.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nThe references you use and cite in your work are your responsibility, regardless of whether you use generative AI tools or not. Assessments containing hallucinated references that do not exist in peer-reviewed journals may be subject to exploratory interviews and reporting to student conduct.\n:::\n\n## Feedback information {#stage2-FIS}\n\n### What type of feedback will I receive for this assessment?\n\nYou will receive feedback on your attainment of the overall marking criteria (Knowledge and Research, Critical Evaluation, Academic Communication) in terms of the verbal descriptors from Schedule A and feedforward comments as to how to develop your knowledge and skills for future assignments.\n\nAssessments are graded on the 22-point scale using the Schedule A marking criteria. There are three equally weighted Assessment Criteria (Knowledge and Research, Critical Evaluation, Academic Communication). You can find out more about Schedule A by [downloading this PDF](https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_541792_smxx.pdf) but the important thing to help you interpret your feedback is the use of the verbal descriptors, i.e., the words like “excellent” and “good” used to describe different grades. You should look out for these words to help you understand how you performed on each ILO.\n\n### Can I get more feedback?\n\nYou are more than welcome to receive additional feedback after the marking process:\n\n- If you would like to discuss your feedback you should first contact the person that marked your assignment. However, we ask that you wait 24 hours after the release of the feedback before you do so to give you time to fully reflect on the feedback given. \n\n- When meeting with the person who marked your assignment, you can discuss feedback and how it relates to your overall grade to help you improve in future assignments. However, do not be worried about attending to discuss how to maintain your standard if you have done better than you expected. You are more than welcome to come discuss any aspect of your feedback or the assignment in general. \n\n- To help any discussion about your feedback, we would ask that you complete the reflection form available on the Moodle page and send that to the person who marked your assignment as part of the discussion, when arranging a meeting.\n\n### How will feedback from this assessment help me in the future?\n\nThe feedback on this assessment will help you in writing future research reports, such as the qualitative report in semester 2, your MSc dissertation, and in any future research work you conduct that requires academic writing and evidence-based evaluation.\n\n### Who assessed my work?\n\nThe first marker for your report will be a member of the Research Methods 1 team within the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\n\nFollowing University’s policy, as part of the marking procedures, the assignment marking will be moderated. The moderator will be another member of the research methods team who will moderate a range of work from across the cohort to ensure that appropriate academic standards have been applied in marking the assignments and that they have been applied consistently across the cohort of students being assessed. \n\n### Can I have my work regraded?\n\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded. That said, even if you are unhappy with your grade, your first point of contact should be to arrange an additional feedback meeting with your marker for further discussion to help explain your feedback and grade. Following this, if you still have concerns you should consult the [guidance from the SRC](https://www.glasgowunisrc.org/advice/academic/appeals/) which provides a clear explanation of the University appeals procedures. \n",
