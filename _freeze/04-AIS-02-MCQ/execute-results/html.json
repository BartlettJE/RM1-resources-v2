This includes lectures, labs, data skills, and research skills. \n\n- In total, this assessment is worth 5% of your final course grade. \n\n- The deadline for submitting the MCQ is **October 24th 2025**. \n\n- You will have **two** attempts to complete the quiz and the **highest** grade will count. So that you get a good sense of where your knowledge and skills are at, please complete the first attempt **without** referring to any notes, the textbook, or any AI tools. On the second attempt, you can use whatever resource you want. The reason we have done this is to provide a safety net so that you can check your learning without the pressure of it affecting your grade.\n\n- The quiz will open one week prior to the deadline, so you can complete the quiz in your own time. However, during each attempt, you must start and finish the quiz in one sitting. Once you start, you **must** finish. \n\n- You have a total of 30 minutes to complete each sitting but you may find that you do the quiz much quicker than that, and that it completely fine. If you are registered with disability services and have an adjustment, you will be given extra time to complete the quiz depending upon your adjustment. If you think you should have extra time but it is not showing on Moodle, please contact James or Thinh **before** starting the quiz. \n\n## How to do well in this assessment\n\n- Keep up with the course content on a weekly basis.\n\n- Complete the essential reading for each lecture.\n\n## Common mistakes\n\n- Not keeping up with the lecture content and reading.\n\n- Failing to read the question carefully.\n\n- Failing to answer all questions. \n\n## Why am I being assessed like this?\n\n- Testing your knowledge of the course content helps you actively engage with the material, meaning you will learn more.\n\n- Distributed practice is important for learning, so we have a few low-stakes assessments early in the course to encourage you to keep up with the content, while being low weighted to reduce the pressure on your overall course grade.\n\n- Engaging with the material on the course will help build a strong foundation for the rest of the RM1 course and your subsequent assessments. \n\n## Academic Integrity\n\nPlease note that when submitting your work for assessment we accept it on the understanding that it is your own effort and work and unique to the set assignment.\n\nTo support you in understanding what plagiarism is and in avoiding it, please read the following resources that the University provides:\n\n- [SRC Advice and Support](https://www.glasgowunisrc.org/advice/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n- [Code of Student Conduct](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/apg/policies/uniregs/regulations2025-26/feesandgeneral/studentsupportandconductmatters/reg33/){target=\"_blank\"} and [Plagiarism & Academic Integrity Code](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/apg/policies/uniregs/regulations2025-26/feesandgeneral/studentsupportandconductmatters/reg32/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n- [Avoiding plagiarism and engage in good academic practice](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/enrol/index.php?id=13038){target=\"_blank\"} (a Moodle course you can self-enrol in).\n\n- [Student support for AI, plagiarism, and digital skills ](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/sld/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n**In summary**:\n\nAll work submitted by students for an assessment is accepted on the understanding that it is the student's own effort. This means students’ work should not contain:\n\n- plagiarised content; or\n\n- content that has been produced by another person, website, software or Artificial intelligence (AI) tool (except where AI use is explicitly permitted); or\n\n- content that has been prepared jointly with any other person (except where this is explicitly permitted); or\n\n- content that has already been submitted for assessment by the student at this or any other institution, known as self-plagiarism.\n\n**Statement on groupwork**: We encourage students to form a study group and peer feedback groups. However, this assignment is not a group work assignment, so your work must be your own individual contribution. If you make a study group or a peer review group, avoid sharing your final answers.\n\n## AI Statement\n\n**University statement on AI**: The University of Glasgow recognises the value of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in academic and professional workplaces. The university has a responsibility to ensure that students acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and other competencies associated within their discipline. The The [Student Learning Development](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/sld/ai/students/){target=\"_blank\"} service provides general guidance and support for students on the use of generative AI. Each item of assessment in your courses will have specific guidance about the use of AI. Where generative AI restrictions are in place, they have been carefully designed to maximise your learning opportunity whilst discouraging reliance on generative AI in a way that undermines your learning or development of good professional practice and graduate attributes.\n\n**School statement on AI**: The School of Psychology and Neuroscience recognises that students may choose to explore the use of AI to assist in learning and assessment. We have a responsibility to guide students in the ethical and effective use of AI tools in order to protect their ability to develop subject-specific skills and knowledge. For this reason, we expect that students will:\n\n- Be mindful and transparent about their use of AI, and confident to declare their use of AI so that we can give effective feedback. \n\n- Respect our guidance on recommended and not recommended use of AI to safeguard their ability to develop as psychologists or neuroscientists.\n\n- Be aware of the risks of using AI (to the environment and to the corpus of human knowledge) and so minimise its use.\n\n- Take personal responsibility for all work they submit for assessment. \n\n**Statement on use of generative AI**: The current assessment is **summative**, meaning that it contributes to your course grade. The purpose of this\nassessment is to showcase the subject-specific knowledge that you have\ndeveloped. There is no expectation that you will use generative AI and we have no evidence that it's use will confer an advantage for this assessment. The purpose of this assessment is to encourage continuous learning over the semester and check your understanding in a low-stakes assessment. The MCQ has a low course grade percentage to reduce pressure and let you focus on learning. Taking short-cuts now will not provide an accurate overview of your understanding and skill development. \n\nIf you do use generative AI tools, we recommend using it for the following (non-exhaustive) kind of tasks: \n\n- Clarify complex concepts and reinforce understanding around intended learning outcomes.\n\n- Plan a revision schedule. \n\n- Generate practice quizzes and questions.\n\nIf you do use generative AI tools, we strongly recommend **not** using it for the following (non-exhaustive) kind of tasks: \n\n- Relying on AI tools for understanding key concepts. \n\n- Helping you to answer the questions. \n\n## Feedback information\n\n### How is this assessment graded?\n\nThe MCQ has 22 questions with each question being worth 1 point. Your grade will be converted into an alphanumeric grade on the standard 22-point scale (e.g., a score of 16 = B2). \n\n### What type of feedback will I receive for this assessment?\n\nOnce the quiz has closed for all students, you will be able to see which questions you got right and wrong, what the correct answer was, and your overall grade. \n\n### Who assessed my work?\n\nThe MCQ is scored automatically within Moodle. The course leads created and proof read the quiz to ensure the scoring is accurate. \n",
