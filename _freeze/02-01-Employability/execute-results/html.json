By the end of the course though, we will not only show you that you can master the content, but we will show you how research methods and statistics provides a wide range of skills and knowledge that will be critical for employability after your degree.\n\nThe blessing and curse of psychology degrees is how it provides a broad range of (transferable) skills and knowledge, but it is not always easy to recognise what skills you have and how they map onto person specifications for graduate-level jobs. In this resource, we focus on our own research methods and statistics course, but you can also apply the same advice to all your other courses. We start with graduate destinations for what skills and knowledge a psychology degree can lead to, we highlight relevant graduate attributes from the University of Glasgow, and finally present skills and knowledge mapping for what we cover on RM1. \n\n## Graduate destinations\n\nAt the start of your degree, we recommend pretending you are looking for a job tomorrow. You are not locked into a decision but looking early means you can explore what essential and desirable criteria they list on person specifications. If you wanted that job tomorrow and you do not possess several criteria, your odds of getting an interview are slimmer. However, if check the criteria a year in advance of when you are applying for jobs, it gives you the time to develop your skills and knowledge for when you will be in that position. \n\nFor some resources, the [British Psychology Society](https://www.bps.org.uk/career-options-in-psychology){target=\"_blank\"} (BPS) outline career options in psychology. Predictably, they are psychology-focused and the odds are you are at least interested in a psychology career if you enrolled in this degree. However, a sizable number of graduates do not work in psychology once they graduate. The [BPS career destinations survey (2017)](https://cms.bps.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-11/BPS%20Careers%20Destinations%20%28Phase%203%29%20Survey%202016%20-%20Dr%20Lisa%20Morrison%20Coulthard.pdf){target=\"_blank\"} reported that 67% of respondents needed a psychology degree for their current job, while 60% had a job in the field of psychology. On the other hand, a [Jisc and Prospects report (2024)](https://graduatemarkettrends.cdn.prismic.io/graduatemarkettrends/Z0Sn968jQArT1SXd_what-do-graduates-do-202425.pdf){target=\"_blank\"} on what graduates do reported a much wider range of jobs. The highest percentage (page 96) for graduates with a psychology degree include childcare, health, and education; legal, social, and welfare; clerical, secretarial, and numerical clerks; health professionals; and smaller numbers of business, HR, and science professionals. \n\nA psychology degree can take you lots of places within and outside the field of psychology, so it is important you can identify the skills and knowledge you have. Before we move onto graduate attributes and skills/knowledge mapping, one thing to keep in mind is your position as an MSc conversion students. You simply do not have the time to reach the depth and breadth in one year that an undergraduate can achieve in three or four years. However, your unique selling point will be your combination of the conversion degree with your previous degree and experience. Many of our MSc conversion students have already completed years in the workplace, so keep this in mind when job criteria ask for related work experience. \n\n## Graduate attributes\n\nThe University of Glasgow lists [graduate attributes](https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_183776_smxx.pdf){target=\"_blank\"} which are the academic abilities, personal qualities, and transferable skills that all graduates can develop over their degree at the university. We recommend reading over the document but they separate the attributes into: \n\n- Subject specialists\n\n- Investigative\n\n- Independent and critical thinkers\n\n- Resourceful and responsible\n\n- Effective communicators \n\n- Confident \n\n- Adaptable\n\n- Experienced collaborators\n\n- Ethically and socially aware\n\n- Reflective learners\n\nYou can find more information on graduate attributes and opportunities available to you on the university [Careers, Employability, and Opportunity](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/careers/){target=\"_blank\"} page. \n\n## Skills and knowledge mapping from RM1\n\nFor graduate level jobs, most of the person specification criteria are split into four sections: \n\n1. Education\n\n2. Experience \n\n3. Knowledge\n\n4. Skills/abilities\n\nFor example, if you look at [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/){target=\"_blank\"}  for psychology jobs, they are mainly academic roles where you would be in the position to apply for something like a research assistant as you graduate. They would ask for a psychology degree (or related) under education, relevant experience such as working with patients/participants, relevant knowledge dependent on the role like research design or neurodiversity, and skills/abilities such as computer skills, data analysis software, and writing skills. \n\nIn RM1, we break the course down into three types of skills: subject knowledge, research skills, and data skills. Note the items within each type of skills is a non-exhaustive list for demonstration purposes. As you move through RM1 (and other courses on the degree), we recommend keeping a note of everything you do to refer back to once you start applying for jobs.  \n\n![](images/Employability_skills.png)\n\nFor example, you will learn about research design and statistics for subject knowledge, literature review tools and reference managers for research skills, and using R/RStudio to wrangle, visualise, and analysis data for data skills. \n\nWe can further break things down for what skills and knowledge you will learn and develop by completing each assessment on the course. \n\n| Assessment                  | Subject knowledge                                                                         | Research skills                                                                                       | Data skills                                                               |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| MCQ                         | Research design; Measurement; Probability; Philosophy of science; Metascience; Statistics | Ethics                                                                                                | RStudio functionality                                                     |\n| Data skills 1               | Statistics                                                                                |                                                                                                       | Reproducible workflows; Data wrangling; Data visualisation                |\n| Data skills 2               | Statistics                                                                                |                                                                                                       | Reproducible workflows; Data wrangling; Data visualisation; Data analysis |\n| Stage One Group Report      | Research design; Measurement; Subject-specific domain knowledge; Statistics               | Ethics; Literature reviewing; Critical evaluation; Academic communication; Computer skills; Team work |                                                                           |\n| Stage Two Individual Report | Research design; Measurement; Subject-specific domain knowledge; Probability; Statistics  | Literature reviewing; Critical evaluation; Academic communication; Computer skills                    | Reproducible workflows; Data wrangling; Data visualisation; Data analysis |\n\n## Example job specification criteria\n\nAs a final demonstration, we have taken a real job advert for a research assistant position to outline the kind of skills/knowledge they are looking for, and highlighting whether you will develop it in RM1, your conversion degree, or whether you would need further development. \n\n> An undergraduate degree that has relevance to the project. BPS accredited undergraduate degree in Psychology (desirable). \n\nThis post is multi-disciplinary, so they invite candidates from a range of subjects. However, a BPS-accredited degree is listed as desirable, so the skills and subject knowledge are beneficial. Keep in mind sometimes people do not quite know how to classify an MSc conversion degree, so you can explain in the cover letter your degree provided BPS-accreditation.\n\n> Understanding of behavioural research methods and questionnaire design and analysis. \n\nIn RM1, you learn about different quantitative research methods and designing/analysing questionnaire data for your research report. Supplementing this with RM2 and your dissertation would tick off this criterion. \n\n> Knowledge of theories and research in traffic and transport psychology and/or behavioural change.\n\nThis is where the specification is asking for subject-specific domain knowledge. You would need to demonstrate this from another course, previous degree, upskilling, or your dissertation if the topic fits. \n\n> An awareness of ethical considerations for conducting research and knowledge of the BPS Code of Human Research Ethics.\n\nWe cover BPS human research ethics on RM1, so you would be able to demonstrate this in addition to RM2 and your dissertation. \n\n> Competence with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint\n\nIn RM1, you will mainly use Word and R Markdown for your stage one and stage two research reports. For data skills, you should have a basic understanding of spreadsheets but you might need to supplement this with further learning about Excel. For example, the university supports Coursera and LinkedIn learning courses if you need to upskill in Excel. We do not cover presentations in RM1, so you would need to demonstrate PowerPoint skills through other courses, previous experience, or upskilling. \n\n> Good writing skills\n\nIn RM1, you will demonstrate good writing skills via your stage one and stage two report. You will then supplement this with essays, reports, and your dissertation elsewhere in the degree. \n\n> Bibliographic research skills \n\nTo support your research report, we cover literature review skills and using a reference manager within RM1. You will also be able to demonstrate this through other essays, reports, and your dissertation elsewhere in the degree. \n\n> Time management and organisation of research/teaching schedules\n\nRM1 is a large course with several assessments, combined with all your other courses and commitments. So, you would be able to mention managing multiple assessments and courses in your degree. For organising research/teaching schedules, this will be related to your dissertation and previous/future experience as this job role has potential teaching responsibilities. \n\n> Confident communication styles\n\nWe already covered writing skills but oral communication is not something you would be able to demonstrate from RM1 specific to assessments. The stage one report does involve team work though, so you would able to link in communicating and problem-solving with a diverse group.  \n\n> Competence with standard analytical packages, such as R Studio (Desirable)\n\nIt is a desirable criterion but this position specifically mentions using RStudio. We directly cover data skills using R/RStudio so you would be able to tick this off alongside RM2 and your dissertation. \n\n> Competence with Adobe software including Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects (Desirable).\n\nIt is a desirable criterion but this is not something we cover on the degree. So, you would need to upskill yourself and maybe you have experience using Photoshop from a previous degree or job role. This is a pretty unusual request for a psychology research assistant position, so this is where as an MSc conversion student your previous degree or work experience might occasionally provide a unique selling point.\n\n> Experience in presenting to an audience \n\nWe do not cover presentations on RM1, so you will need other courses involving presentations and previous/future experience to tick off this criterion. \n\n> Experience in conducting and management at least one project, collecting and analysing data, and writing a report.\n\nIn RM1, you plan a research project in a team for your stage one report, and analyse data and write a stage two report. You will also write a full research report in RM2. You will not collect data yourself in RM1, but you will for your dissertation if you use primary data. \n",
