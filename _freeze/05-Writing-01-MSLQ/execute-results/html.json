Throughout the lectures, labs, and independent learning, you will learn how to formulate a research question, design a study, apply statistical analyses, and write up your results to communicate to others as a research report. \n\nIn your group, you will decide on a topic and collectively write a stage one registered report ([see the stage one AIS](#stage1-AIS)) which contains an introduction and method section for how you plan on addressing your research question. Individually, you will then write a stage two registered report ([see the stage two AIS](#stage2-AIS)) which contains a results, discussion, and abstract section. You have more than enough to learn about in this course without worrying about designing a study, applying for ethics, and collecting data yourselves. Therefore, we have developed two projects for you and your group to choose from and pick your own adventure. \n\nOne project focuses on sustainability and the other project focuses on inclusion/belonging. The British Psychological Society (BPS) identified both of these topics as two key areas that psychology graduates can contribute to for evidence-based understanding, policy, and intervention. As psychology students, you will learn about research methods and statistics with an applied focus, to robustly and reproducibly address research questions relevant to psychology. \n\nWe have already designed and prepared the projects you will work with in your groups. You will write a stage one and stage two registered report from the perspective of the researcher as if you conducted the studies yourselves, but you will only help us to collect data and add to the participant pool. This reduces pressure and gives you time to focus on learning about research methods and statistics before you design your own studies in future courses and in your dissertation. Autonomy is important in education though, so you have the choice between two projects to decide on as a group, and within each project there is flexibility in the research questions you can develop. \n\nThe rest of this chapter outlines starter packs to learn more about the two projects and give you a starting point for your research, so please read through in advance of your first lab. \n\n## Sustainability starter pack\n\n### Study background\n\nEating meat is a key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. One potential low cost intervention to reduce meat eating is using dynamic norms in the messaging behind adopting more sustainable behaviours. A dynamic norm is where you highlight the change of a norm over time, such as more people recently changing their behaviour to eat less meat. In contrast, a static norm describes it's current state. @sparkman_dynamic_2017 demonstrated that dynamic norms would lead to greater intention to eat less meat than static norms. However, studies like @aldoh_shifting_2024 have struggled to replicate the finding and question whether it translates to actual behaviour. \n\nIn our study, we include items on meat eating for a replication of previous work on the effect of dynamic norms but we also offer an extension opportunity to explore the effect of dynamic norms on alternative types of sustainable behaviour like using public transport and reusable cups/bottles. \n\n### Why is this topic important? \n\nThe BPS highlight the role of psychology research in responding to challenges/opportunities relating to the United Nationâ€™s (UN) [sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals){target=\"_blank\"}. Psychologists have the tools to conduct research to inform evidence-based policy and interventions in addressing these goals. The goals most relevant to this project are 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 13 (climate action).\n\n### Relevant theory \n\nOne popular theory relating to behaviour change is the COM-B model of behaviour [@michie_behaviour_2011]. The aim of this theory is to explain why a specific behavior occurs and how to create interventions that lead to effective change in that behaviour. COM-B stands for capability (C), opportunity (O), and motivation (M), relating to a given behaviour (B). Ask yourselves the following questions:\n\n- How well regarded is the COM-B model? Does empirical evidence generally support it as a theory of human behaviour?\n\n- How might the COM-B model apply to understanding adopting more sustainable behaviours such as meat eating, using public transport, and using reusable cups/bottles? \n\n- Based on the theory, what kind of effect from dynamic norms do you predict to find? \n\n### Research design \n\nYou will be unfamiliar with a lot of this terminology at the start of the course, but we outline it nice and early to help refine your research question and know what variables you will have available since you did not design the study yourself.\n\nThere is one **independent variable** with two levels. We randomise participants into one of two groups: they receive a dynamic norm statement or they receive a static norm statement.\n\nThere are three potential **dependent variables** which measure interest in adopting a more sustainable behaviour. For this course, we *heavily* recommend choosing just one of the measures given the word count of the stage one and stage two registered report assessments. The three dependent variables are:\n\n1. How interested are you in eating less meat? We measure this on a 0 (not at all interested) to 100 (extremely interested) scale. \n\n2. How interested are you in using more public transport? We measure this on a 0 (not at all interested) to 100 (extremely interested) scale. \n\n3. How interested are you in using a reusable cup or bottle for takeout purchases? We measure this on a 0 (not at all interested) to 100 (extremely interested) scale. \n\nWe then have a selection of others variables available for reporting or identifying a specific sample such as age, gender, vegetarian status, political position, student status, and self-reported data quality. You will see more information on the wording and options behind these variables in the code book and Qualtrics walkthrough. \n\n### Potential research questions \n\nIn this introductory course, we focus on analysing research designs with two variables. Most relevant to this project is one independent variable (dynamic vs static norms) and one dependent variable of your choice from the three sustainable behaviours. For example, you might focus on a replication with a research question on eating meat like: \n\n> \"Do dynamic norms lead to greater intentions to eat less meat compared to static norms?\"\n\nOn the other hand, you might explore one of the other dependent variables as an extension and develop a research question like: \n\n> \"Do dynamic norms lead to greater intentions to use more public transport compared to static norms?\"\n\nWhile we focus on two variables for the design and analysis in this course, you could develop a more specific research question in your stage one report by identifying a specific sample/population:\n\n> \"Do dynamic norms lead to greater intentions to eat less meat compared to static norms in international students?\"\n\nThese are only examples for inspiration and you are welcome to develop an alternative evidence-based research question in your groups providing it is possible within the constraints of the study design.\n\n## Belonging starter pack\n\n### Study background\n\nPlaceholder. \n\n### Why is this topic important? \n\nPlaceholder.\n\n### Relevant theory \n\nPlaceholder.\n\n### Research design \n\nPlaceholder.\n\n### Potential research questions \n\nPlaceholder.\n\n## Research project topic\n\n### MSLQ\n\nThe broad topic of the research project is **self-regulated learning**. \n\nSelf-regulated learning models describe learning in terms of taking control of and evaluating one's own learning and behaviour. The study you will write up uses a questionnaire called the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ, Pintrich et al., 1991).\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Supporting/self-reg-learning.jpg){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MSLQ has two sections, motivation and learning strategies, each with multiple sub-scales. One of these scales may form part of the analysis you write up. There is more information about what each of these scales measures in the MSLQ Overview document, which you can [download using this link](Supporting/MSLQ Overview.docx), or you can find it on the Week 1 Moodle page.\n\n**Motivation sub-scales**\n\n- Intrinsic goal orientation\n\n- Extrinsic goal orientation\n\n- Task value\n\n- Control beliefs\n\n- Self-efficacy\n\n- Test anxiety\n\n**Learning strategy sub-scales**\n\n- Rehearsal\n\n- Elaboration\n\n- Organisation\n\n- Critical thinking\n\n- Meta-cognition\n\n- Time and study environment\n\n- Effort regulation\n\n- Peer learning\n\n- Help-seeking\n\n### Demographic variables\n\nIn addition to the MSLQ, we also have a selection of demographic information about the participants and you may choose to use one of these variables in your analysis, or use it to isolate a particular population of interest.\n\n- Age in years\n\n- Gender (male/female/non-binary)\n\n- Native vs non-native speakers\n\n- Paid employment in hours\n\n- Living at home vs living in halls\n\n- Level of study (undergraduate vs postgraduate)\n\n- Mature student vs traditional student (for undergraduate students only)\n\n## Distinguishing types of research questions\n\nFor the research question (what you want to try and answer with your project) you develop in your group, there are two main types for the designs we introduce you to in this course. First, you might be interested in the relationship between two variables, such as whether an increase in one variable is associated with an increase in another variable. Second, you might be interested in whether two groups differ on a given outcome.  \n\nFor relationships, if you are thinking about which sub-scales might be correlated with each other or related, you might ask such research questions as: \n\n1. Is there a relationship between help-seeking and test anxiety?\n\n2. Is there an association between intrinsic goal orientation and effort regulation?\n\nIf you are thinking about which sub-scales might show group differences, you might ask such research questions as:\n\n1. Do mature students have lower test anxiety than traditional students?\n\n2. Do postgraduate students have higher intrinsic motivation than undergraduate students?\n\nWe will go into more detail about how to create formal research questions and hypotheses in future weeks. Starting in week 2, we will show you how to find peer-reviewed evidence to build your understanding of the variables, identify a rationale, and develop your research question and hypothesis.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nYou will have freedom to develop a research question in your group but since you are using secondary data, there are constraints. Keep in mind you only have the variables listed above available to you. This course is also introductory, so we intentionally restrict you to focusing on two variables. You will learn how to test more complex research questions in RM2 / semester 2. \n:::\n\n## MSLQ suggested variable pairs\n\nNow you have an understanding of what the MSLQ project is, we have a list of variable pairs that have worked well in the past and we know that there is some existing literature to base your study on. We would like you to read through these pairs for different types of designs you will learn about in the semester. When you complete the variable preference form, you will put your name down next to the pair you are most interested in, and we will use this to try and organise people into groups with similar interests. Just keep in mind we cannot always match people as there might be too many people with the same interests per lab, so there will still be an element of randomness to your groups.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n#### Can I still change my mind?\nThis seems like a big decision to make so early, but we use your initial interests to arrange people into groups when you might not know other people in your lab yet. You can choose different variables once you are in your groups, but we outlined these as we know they can work well together for the report, and you must make any changes in collaboration with all the members of your group. Once you settle on two variables, you might also focus on a specific population in your group as you develop your rationale, like focusing on postgraduate students if you recognise there is a gap in the literature, so there is still creative freedom beyond choosing the variable pairs. \n:::\n\n### Variable pairs for comparing two groups\n\n- Test anxiety and undergraduate vs postgraduate, or years 1 and 2 vs years 3-5 (pre-honours vs honours at the University of Glasgow)\n\n- Help-seeking and first vs second language \n\n- Meta-cognitive self-regulation and non-mature vs mature undergraduate student status\n\n- Meta-cognitive self-regulation and undergraduate vs postgraduate study, or years 1 and 2 vs years 3-5 (pre-honours vs honours at the University of Glasgow)\n\n- Self-efficacy and undergraduate vs postgraduate study\n\n- Intrinsic motivation and undergraduate vs postgraduate study\n\n### Variable pairs for the association between two variables. \n\n- Self-efficacy and help-seeking\n\n- Test anxiety and meta-cognitive self-regulation\n\n- Test anxiety and self-efficacy \n\n- Self-efficacy and help-seeking\n\n- Intrinsic motivation and age\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\nNow you have read through the MSLQ and project overview, think about which variable pairs interest you the most and put your name down next to the pair that you want to start exploring on the variable interest form (available on Moodle). We will start putting you in groups in week 2 so you have as much time as possible to work on your group project. \n:::\n",
