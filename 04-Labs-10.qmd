# Week 10

## Lab overview

Welcome to week 10 which is the final lab of RM! 

Great work so far as this is one of the most intense courses you will complete. We must cover a lot of content in a short space of time to develop foundational skills for RM2 and your dissertation. 

## Tasks to complete prior to your lab

1. Read the [data processing and structure of the discussion](#processing-discussion1) chapter.

2. Download and access the full data set and data processing guidance script from Moodle. 

## Tasks to complete after attending your lab

1. Finalise your processing and analysis script to address your research question and hypothesis (if applicable) from the stage one report. 

2. Start drafting the results section for your stage two individual report. 

## Next week

Next week is the final lecture and lab of the course and semester. You have come a long way since the start of the programme, so we hope you are very proud of yourselves to build all this subject knowledge, research skills, and data skills in such a short space of time. 

In the lab, we will revisit the discussion section to focus more on identifying limitations and evaluation skills. Finally, we will return to the abstract as the first thing you see, but its typically written last to summarise the whole report.
