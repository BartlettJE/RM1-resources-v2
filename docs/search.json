You do not have to use all the different sources of support, and some will work better for you than others will. Part of learning is about finding what helps you best. Below are a few of the main approaches we have on this course to help you and if in doubt, please just ask:\n\nWeekly lab sessions with your tutor with time for questions in each lab;\nGraduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) support sessions in-person and online;\nTeams channel for discussion, questions, and support;\nStudent Office Hours (sometimes called Student Drop-in Hours) - just turn up and ask anything;\nAssessment information sheets and common questions and answer documents to support assignments.\n\nThe best approach is to write down your questions when they come up, check the available material for answers, and if you are still unsure after that, use one of the approaches above.\nHowever, please note we would ask that you do not send questions, either about a topic or an assignment, as a direct message on Teams to an individual staff member. While we always want to help, this approach is not sustainable and there is a highly likely chance your question will get missed and go unanswered. We would strongly encourage you to post the question on the course Team channel, as that way staff and students have the opportunity to answer your question, and other students can benefit from the answer. Alternatively, use the student office hours or your lab sessions to ask questions more privately."

These walk through learning R/RStudio and applying data skills such as wrangling data, visualisation, and inferential statistics. However, we appreciate you may have questions or encounter errors you cannot work out on your own. That is why we schedule weekly support sessions with our GTAs.\nThe GTA support sessions are drop-in sessions, meaning they are not timetabled classes you must attend. They are there to go to if you have a problem, and you can come and ask questions. Our GTAs may demonstrate techniques or how to fix problems, but they are not intended to be chapter walkthroughs. The idea is you engage in self-directed study, and then you can come to the support sessions if you encounter problems.\nEarly in the semester, the support sessions have open invites. This means anyone can drop in and there might be a handful of students present and asking questions. However, as we approach key assessment periods, the sessions will have specific sign up slots to ensure the GTAs can provide clearly defined equitable time to each sign-up."

We work through chapters 1 to 11 in RM1, then you will continue with chapters 12 to 14 in RM2.\nData skills takes time and trial and error to learn. We direct you to one or two chapters per week to develop your initial skills. Each chapter has a range of “try this” activities to apply what you learnt and check your answers against solutions. We also have “error mode” activities to get you used to making errors in coding. This can be the most intimidating part of learning to code but experienced coders do not stop making mistakes, they just get better at diagnosing and fixing their mistakes. Finally, we have data analysis journey chapters. These provide longer less structured activities to get you wrangling, visualising, and/or analysing data sets. These are meant as the bridge between the core chapters to your assessments where you no longer have solutions to check your answers against."

    "text": "3.1 General information\nWe use the group work agreement to outline how you and your group will work and communicate with each other, and ensure you are engaging in the group work process for the stage one group report. Groups typically experience problems when communication and task responsibilities are built on unspoken assumptions. As you probably do not know the people in your group when we make the allocations, we start the project by facilitating a discussion with you and your group so you can openly outline how you will communicate, respect diversity, and split tasks.\n\nThis is a formative task and is not part of the summative assessment for the course, but everyone must complete the task. We use the group work agreement as a way of identifying engagement and potential problems as early as possible. The course or programme leads will contact students who do not submit their group work agreement and students will potentially be placed on an individual submission if they do not engage with their groups.\nThe deadline is October 11th 2024, where everyone in the group must submit an individual signed copy of the agreement you worked on.\nAlthough you will agree on the document as a group, each group member must then individually sign (electronic or a printed name, you do not need to physically sign it) and upload a copy to the submission portal.\nYou should submit a single Word document (.docx) or PDF document to Moodle prior to the deadline. The submission link is open from when the group allocations are available in week 2. You can find the submission portal in the Formative: Allocations and group work agreement submission tab."

Here is a list of items you may want to discuss with your group and add to the document:\n\nWe all agree to establish a common timeline for the project and discuss any deviations from the timeline together as a group.\nWe all agree to communicate with each other openly and honestly about the project and get in touch with the course leads in the event of an unsolvable group conflict.\nWe all agree to respect each other’s individual ways of working and discuss these openly as a group.\nWe all agree to respect diversity in our group. This includes cultural differences, neurodiversity, different work/life situations and may manifest in different ways of working/approaching tasks. We agree to discuss our strengths as a group and divide tasks accordingly.\nI agree to stay in touch with the group and communicate as established by the group.

    "text": "3.3 Effective group work advice\n\n3.3.1 Guidelines\nBelow are some guidelines to organise and manage your group project for the stage one report. You are welcome to adapt some of these guidelines to suit your group and the nature of the project. However, in the event we need to mediate difficulties, this will involve you providing evidence as record/evidence of collaboration (or lack thereof). Please be mindful of this when conducting your project.\nSet up your group Teams chat/channel and a Microsoft Planner for your group\n\nDO: Create a Teams chat for communication with your group.\nDO: Create a Microsoft Planner with all members of your group to assign individual tasks (we recommend copying this Planner template for the stage one group report we have created. Please copy the Planner, do not edit it.).\nDON’T: Use WhatsApp, Facebook or WeChat etc. to coordinate your project as that excludes people who cannot access this technology in some countries.\n\nCoordinate work schedules/calendars\n\nDO: Be open about when you can meet/study, if you have a busy period coming up, or might be unavailable.\nDO: Schedule a regular ‘check-in’ time. This does not need to be a live meeting but stay connected regularly.\nDON’T: Commit to meetings/time frames that will not work for your timetable or work schedule.\n\nAgree on document collaboration platforms\n\nDO: We recommend having a shared OneDrive folder or sharing documents within your Teams channel using the files tab.\nDO: Use track changes and comments on shared documents.\nDO: Think about a shared Zotero, EndNote, or similar reference manager to organise papers.\n\nWork back from the deadline to create milestones\n\nDO: Be mindful of your work/life balance and upcoming busy periods.\nDO: Agree on specific dates to complete your responsibilities.\nDON’T: Leave things to the last minute.\n\nDetermine strengths and assign roles\n\nDO: Consult the Stage one group work planning advice section below to identify the strengths/preferences of your team.\n\nAssign tasks/milestones to roles\n\nDO: Attach names and dates to tasks and assign milestones using the Microsoft Planner template.\nDO: Reassign tasks/adjust deadlines as the project progresses if you need to.\nDON’T: Assign time-sensitive roles that might clash with someone’s known upcoming commitments.\n\nCommunicate, communicate, communicate\n\nDO: Check-in regularly.\nDO: Agree to action points at the end of meetings and put these in writing (e.g., in a shared document / to-do list).\nDO: Let your group know if you are struggling with a task/milestone.\nDO: Be kind and compassionate (to yourself and others).\nDON’T: Take things personally. We all know text/online communication can sound differently from how it is intended.\n\nSubmit your Assessment\n\nDO: Assign one person to prepare and submit the final documents when everyone has approved them. Remember to turn off track changes.\nDO: Give yourself time to look at the Turnitin Report.\nDON’T: Forget to check you are uploading the correct intended file.\n\n3.3.2 Points about inclusivity\nLanguage: Many/most students in this programme are studying in their second, third, or even fourth language. Consider the challenges you might experience if you were studying beyond your first language and be mindful of making implicit judgements about someone’s writing or communication.\nTiming/working patterns: Be mindful that everyone’s work/life balance and commitments are different. Some people prefer studying during traditional working hours, some in the evenings, and others on weekends. Communicate your preferences openly and as a group be as flexible and accommodating as you can. Can the times/days of meetings be flexible if this helps everyone contribute and feel engaged?\nTechnology: The technology/platforms we recommend might not be your favourites, but we recommend them for a reason. These are things we can directly support, and they are the things that we make sure all students in different countries can access. Using some apps/tools can explicitly exclude some members that want to engage and contribute.\nNeurodiversity: Different people work and think in different ways. If someone discloses that they find particular things challenging, or that they are at their best with a particular type of task or activity, consider how you can support/reflect this in the allocation of roles and tasks.\n\n3.3.3 Supporting self-efficacy/group dynamics\nOstracism: Group dynamics can be one of the trickiest things to manage in a project, especially if you feel like you are the “new person” coming into an established group. For the sake of everyone and your project, avoid implicitly or explicitly creating an in-group/out-group situation and ostracising people.\nPositivity: Try to maintain a positive tone about the project, even if you find it challenging. There is a fine line between having a little vent/catharsis and creating an atmosphere of toxic negativity. Some team members might take this to heart more than others and become dispirited about the activity, their abilities, and the completion of the task. If you are feeling frustrated or finding a particular thing challenging, talk to your group and consider seeking advice or support from the teaching team.\nImposter syndrome: It does not matter how we might be coping, sometimes it is impossible to avoid feeling like you or your work might not be good enough. If you are anxious about sharing something with your group, seek feedback from someone you trust first for their advice. Do not be afraid to make mistakes. Think about your shared documents as ‘working drafts’. Do not think you have to be anything other than who you are with your group. The pressure of thinking you must pretend to be a “model” student or meet the perceived expectations of others can get in the way of your being able to contribute your unique skills and experience."

    "text": "3.4 Stage one group work task sharing advice\nAs you start working in your groups, one key decision will be sharing out the tasks equitably. In the stage one report template, there are several sections and sub-sections to complete. For each component, try to summarise the following when you first meet with your group:\n\nWhat information have you already established in that section?\nWhat do you still need to think about for that section?\nHow are you going to find answers to the things you do not yet know?\n\nFor example, you might say for the rationale, research question, and hypothesis component of the introduction:\n\nWhat have you already established?: So far, we know the research question and the hypothesis, and we have a general summary of relevant papers written by the team.\nWhat do we still need to think about?: We do not yet have a fully formed rationale or a solid understanding of the general overview.\nHow will you find answers to things you do not yet know? Helena, James, and Ashley will read the papers that have already been collected and the general literature review. From there, they will try to summarise the rationale so that it builds on what previous research has found. They will then present that to the group for further revision and discussion.\n\nOnce you have done that for each section, go through and answer the following question: Who will lead on each section?\nEach group member should make an equal contribution, but this does not mean every group member works on every section. Some sections might work better with one person leading and another editing, while other sections might work better with several people leading and editing.\nThe introduction is a larger section with fewer clearly segmented tasks, whereas the method is shorter with clearly defined sub-sections. It is important you understand all aspects of the prospect, so we recommend if you work on writing the introduction, you edit or at least proof-read the method, and vice versa.\nFor example, you might separate the tasks as:\n\nIntroduction literature review: Phil, Helena, and Ashley will lead on this section.\nIntroduction rationale, research question, and hypothesis: Helena, James, and Ashley will lead on this section.\nMethod participants: James and Phil will lead on this section.\nMethod materials: James and Wil will lead on this section.\nMethod procedure: Ashley and Sarune will lead on this section.\nMethod design and data analysis: Sarune and Wil will lead on this section.\n\nYou might choose to separate the tasks differently, but this is one suggestion to work through. We support this the Planner template for the stage one group report, so we recommend at least starting with this plan and allocate roles, and then adapt as you need.\nFor this separation or another approach you agree in your group, question what you know, what you still need to think about, and how you will fill in the blanks:\nIntroduction literature review\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nIntroduction rationale, research question, and hypothesis\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod participants\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod materials\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod procedure\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod design and data analysis\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nWho will lead on each section?\n\nIntroduction literature review:\nIntroduction rationale, research question, and hypothesis:\nMethod participants:\nMethod materials:\nMethod procedure:\nMethod design and data analysis:\n\nYou can either copy and adapt these questions to work on in your own document, copy the Planner template to your own Microsoft University account, or download this template to structure your group discussions."

All the assignments build on each other and information within the formative assignments will help to complete the summative assignments.\nUse the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis data skills book activities to guide you. In almost all cases (apart from where we highlight), the answers to the assignments require using skills that you have already covered in these materials.\nAvoid making changes to the .Rmd file other than to provide answers and your GUID (e.g., avoid deleting backticks, changing code chunk names, not using the file provided). If you edit the file in a way that affects how the .Rmd knits, such as deleting backticks or changing code chunk names, your submission may be invalid and be returned with a H grade.\nPlease pay special attention if the question asks for a specific output, e.g. value or a data_frame. For example, when asked for a value as an output, make sure it is a single value and not a value stored in a data frame. Finally, when altering code inside the code blocks, do not re-order, rename, or remove the code blocks (e.g. T01, T02, etc.). If you do, this will impact your grade and may result in you receiving a H grade for this assignment. If you are unsure about any of these points, please ask a member of staff.\nRead the question carefully and ensure that you provide exactly what we ask you (e.g., code or a single value). Do not deviate from what the question asks. We encourage you to practice different approaches in your own time, but for these assignments you should only do what the questions ask.\nTest that the .Rmd file you are submitting is reproducible after completing it, by “knitting” it as a html file. This also shows what you have accomplished and allows you to spot potential errors. If your code does not knit, this may result in you receiving an H grade for this assignment, so please check carefully.\nA great test of your code is to close R Studio, restart it, open and knit your code, see that it runs, and go through it to make sure you consider the answers to be correct. This will test whether you have remembered to include essential elements, such as libraries, in your code. This does not necessarily mean that your code is correct, only that your code runs. You need to check the output and compare to the question to see that it matches.\nWhen loading in data, you must use a relative path as opposed to an absolute path. Relative would mean having the data file in the same folder as the .Rmd file and just calling the data file when reading it in, e.g. read_csv(\"data.csv\"). Absolute would be using a path specific to the folder structure of your computer, e.g. read_csv(\"C:/JamesComputer/JamesFolder/data.csv\"). Only use relative paths and under no circumstances should you rename the data file from the one we tell you to use. The file name “data.csv” is different from “data (1).csv” and “data_1.csv”. Only use the name we give you.\nThe following functions are considered forbidden and must not appear anywhere in your code at all. Inclusion of them in your code may result in you receiving a H grade for the assignment. The functions are: install.packages(), help(), vignette(), setwd(),help.start(), or View().\nCollate your notes and learn from your mistakes. These assignments are weighted low to give you the space to make mistakes and to not have a major impact on your overall course grade. Try and take advantage of this opportunity to test your skill development and prepare you for the larger report components and your future dissertation."

If it does not match what we expect, then it is wrong. Remember the point is about being reproducible and replicable.

    "text": "5.9 Feedback information\n\n5.9.1 How is this assessment graded?\nEach data skills assignment will have several questions with each question being worth either 1 or 2 points. Your grade will be converted into an alphanumeric grade on the standard Glasgow 22-point Schedule A scale (e.g., a score of 16 = B2).\n\n5.9.2 How will the feedback from this assessment help me in the future?\nThe practical data skills assignments will help you develop your transferable data skills to complete future work that requires working with data, such as your dissertation, and courses or jobs that require such skills. Additionally, as you will see, these skills can be used for tasks such as writing reports, creating reference sections, conducting text analyses and building websites, as well as a wealth of other tasks and is therefore an extremely useful transferable skill. These skills also give you a much deeper understanding of data and research.\n\n5.9.3 What type of feedback will I receive for this assessment?\nFor these assignments, you will get a feedback sheet for each assignment that tells you whether you received full, partial, or no credit for each task/question within the assignment.\nYou will receive individual feedback on each task within an assignment, telling you where your answer was acceptable or telling you what was incorrect about your answer. You will also see the correct answer to each task within an assignment along with a short piece of generic feedback for that task.\nWe will also make a solution to the assignment available that you should compare to your own work to see alternative approaches, or to see where you have gone wrong, and to see what you have done correctly.\n\n5.9.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe assignments will be graded by an experienced member of staff using computer-assisted marking. Note that this is not automated marking as the member of staff has the final say on all submitted answers and checks the process at every step. In the first instance, we compare the output of your answer to the expected output or the code used to the code requested. If these comparisons match then you are given full credit for the task. If your answer does not match what was asked for in the task, then the member of staff manually checks your output to the expected output, or your code to the expected code, and to the question asked, to see if your code/output still answers the question or not. A decision is then made on whether to award full, partial, or no credit for that task.\n\n5.9.5 Can I get more feedback?\nYes! We encourage you discuss your assessment first with the marker or course lead (regardless of what grade you received) and you can do so either by messaging the marker or course lead directly to arrange an appointment. You can also speak to the GTA team about your coding skills for further development. All staff contact details can be found on the University of Glasgow directory.\n\n5.9.6 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded. That said, even if you are unhappy with your grade, your first point of contact should be to arrange an additional feedback meeting with your marker for further discussion to help explain your feedback and grade. Following this, if you still have concerns you should consult the guidance from the SRC which provides a clear explanation of the University appeals procedures."

There are three equally weighted Assessment Criteria (Knowledge and Research, Critical Evaluation, Academic Communication). You can find out more about Schedule A by downloading this PDF but the important thing to help you interpret your feedback is the use of the verbal descriptors, i.e., the words like “excellent” and “good” used to describe different grades. You should look out for these words to help you understand how you performed on each ILO.\n\n6.12.2 Can I get more feedback?\nYou are more than welcome to receive additional feedback after the marking process:\n\nIf you would like to discuss your feedback you should first contact the person that marked your assignment. However, we ask that you wait 24 hours after the release of the feedback before you do so to give you time to fully reflect on the feedback given.\nWhen meeting with the person who marked your assignment, you can discuss feedback and how it relates to your overall grade to help you improve in future assignments. However, do not be worried about attending to discuss how to maintain your standard if you have done better than you expected. You are more than welcome to come discuss any aspect of your feedback or the assignment in general.\nTo help any discussion about your feedback, we would ask that you complete the reflection form available on the Moodle page and send that to the person who marked your assignment as part of the discussion, when arranging a meeting.\n\n6.12.3 How will feedback from this assessment help me in the future?\nPrimarily, the feedback on this assessment will help support the analysis and write-up of the stage two individual report in this course. Additionally, the feedback will help support your qualitative report in RM2, as well as your dissertation and in any future research work you conduct that requires data analysis, decision-making, and evidence-based justification.\n\n6.12.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe first marker for your report will be a member of the research methods team within the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\nFollowing University’s policy, as part of the marking procedures, the assignment marking will be moderated. The moderator will be another member of the research methods team who will moderate a range of work from across the cohort to ensure that appropriate academic standards have been applied in marking the assignments and that they have been applied consistently across the cohort of students being assessed.\n\n6.12.5 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded.

We direct you to one or two chapters per week to develop your initial skills. Each chapter has a range of “try this” activities to apply what you learnt and check your answers against solutions. We also have “error mode” activities to get you used to making errors in coding. This can be the most intimidating part of learning to code but experienced coders do not stop making mistakes, they just get better at diagnosing and fixing their mistakes. Finally, we have data analysis journey chapters. These provide longer less structured activities to get you wrangling, visualising, and/or analysing data sets.

For further information on the individual stage two report, please refer to the Assessment Information Sheet.\nYou should submit a single Word document (.docx) to Moodle prior to the deadline. The submission link will open at least one week prior to the deadline and will be in the Assessment: Stage One Group and Stage Two Individual Reports tab on Moodle.\nAs a formative task and to outline ground rules for working in your group, you will complete and submit a group work agreement. We will introduce this document to you in week 2 when you will know your group allocation, but it will involve agreeing to how you will work in and contribute to your group.

All the assignments build on each other and information within the formative assignments will help to complete the summative assignments.\nUse the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis data skills book activities to guide you. In almost all cases (apart from where we highlight), the answers to the assignments require using skills that you have already covered in these materials.\nAvoid making changes to the .Rmd file other than to provide answers and your GUID (e.g., avoid deleting backticks, changing code chunk names, not using the file provided). If you edit the file in a way that affects how the .Rmd knits, such as deleting backticks or changing code chunk names, your submission may be invalid and be returned with a H grade.\nPlease pay special attention if the question asks for a specific output, e.g. value or a data_frame. For example, when asked for a value as an output, make sure it is a single value and not a value stored in a data frame. Finally, when altering code inside the code blocks, do not re-order, rename, or remove the code blocks (e.g. T01, T02, etc.). If you do, this will impact your grade and may result in you receiving a H grade for this assignment. If you are unsure about any of these points, please ask a member of staff.\nRead the question carefully and ensure that you provide exactly what we ask you (e.g., code or a single value). Do not deviate from what the question asks. We encourage you to practice different approaches in your own time, but for these assignments you should only do what the questions ask.\nTest that the .Rmd file you are submitting is reproducible after completing it, by “knitting” it as a html file. This also shows what you have accomplished and allows you to spot potential errors. If your code does not knit, this may result in you receiving an H grade for this assignment, so please check carefully.\nA great test of your code is to close R Studio, restart it, open and knit your code, see that it runs, and go through it to make sure you consider the answers to be correct. This will test whether you have remembered to include essential elements, such as libraries, in your code. This does not necessarily mean that your code is correct, only that your code runs. You need to check the output and compare to the question to see that it matches.\nWhen loading in data, you must use a relative path as opposed to an absolute path. Relative would mean having the data file in the same folder as the .Rmd file and just calling the data file when reading it in, e.g. read_csv(\"data.csv\"). Absolute would be using a path specific to the folder structure of your computer, e.g. read_csv(\"C:/JamesComputer/JamesFolder/data.csv\"). Only use relative paths and under no circumstances should you rename the data file from the one we tell you to use. The file name “data.csv” is different from “data (1).csv” and “data_1.csv”. Only use the name we give you.\nThe following functions are considered forbidden and must not appear anywhere in your code at all. Inclusion of them in your code may result in you receiving a H grade for the assignment. The functions are: install.packages(), help(), vignette(), setwd(),help.start(), or View().\nCollate your notes and learn from your mistakes. These assignments are weighted low to give you the space to make mistakes and to not have a major impact on your overall course grade. Try and take advantage of this opportunity to test your skill development and prepare you for the larger report components and your future dissertation."

We will check any incorrect answers and if you have used different code that produces what is asked you will still get the mark, however, using different code from the book increases the risk that you will produce a different output to the one intended. We designed these tasks based on what we expect you will have learnt.\nFailure to follow instructions (e.g., writing code when we requested a single value).\nIncluding any forbidden code in your .Rmd file, e.g., install.packages(). You should never write code that would change something on someone else’s machine.\nWe always ask students to use the function read_csv() to load in data, yet students often use read.csv(). There is a difference between the output these create, so always do what the questions ask.\nBe very careful with spelling. For example, UK is not the same as Uk.\nNever do more than what the question asks. We check the output of a task to see that it matches what we expect. If it does not match what we expect, then it is wrong. Remember the point is about being reproducible and replicable. Think of this in terms of you are sending your work to a colleague who expects a certain thing, and if your code works differently, then that is not good practice.\nTry things out in the console and in your own scripts, but only put your final answers in the .Rmd.\nFailing to read your feedback from previous assignments.\nFailing to check that your code knits before submitting it.\nFailing to check that you are submitting the right file.

Additionally, as you will see, these skills can be used for tasks such as writing reports, creating reference sections, conducting text analyses and building websites, as well as a wealth of other tasks and is therefore an extremely useful transferable skill. These skills also give you a much deeper understanding of data and research.\n\n5.10.3 What type of feedback will I receive for this assessment?\nFor these assignments, you will get a feedback sheet for each assignment that tells you whether you received full, partial, or no credit for each task/question within the assignment.\nYou will receive individual feedback on each task within an assignment, telling you where your answer was acceptable or telling you what was incorrect about your answer. You will also see the correct answer to each task within an assignment along with a short piece of generic feedback for that task.\nWe will also make a solution to the assignment available that you should compare to your own work to see alternative approaches, or to see where you have gone wrong, and to see what you have done correctly.\n\n5.10.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe assignments will be graded by an experienced member of staff using computer-assisted marking. Note that this is not automated marking as the member of staff has the final say on all submitted answers and checks the process at every step. In the first instance, we compare the output of your answer to the expected output or the code used to the code requested. If these comparisons match then you are given full credit for the task. If your answer does not match what was asked for in the task, then the member of staff manually checks your output to the expected output, or your code to the expected code, and to the question asked, to see if your code/output still answers the question or not. A decision is then made on whether to award full, partial, or no credit for that task.\n\n5.10.5 Can I get more feedback?\nYes! We encourage you discuss your assessment first with the marker or course lead (regardless of what grade you received) and you can do so either by messaging the marker or course lead directly to arrange an appointment. You can also speak to the GTA team about your coding skills for further development. All staff contact details can be found on the University of Glasgow directory.\n\n5.10.6 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded. That said, even if you are unhappy with your grade, your first point of contact should be to arrange an additional feedback meeting with your marker for further discussion to help explain your feedback and grade. Following this, if you still have concerns you should consult the guidance from the SRC which provides a clear explanation of the University appeals procedures."

    "text": "7.13 Feedback information\n\n7.13.1 What type of feedback will I receive for this assessment?\nYou will receive feedback on your attainment of the overall marking criteria (Knowledge and Research, Critical Evaluation, Academic Communication) in terms of the verbal descriptors from Schedule A and feedforward comments as to how to develop your knowledge and skills for future assignments.\nAssessments are graded on the 22-point scale using the Schedule A marking criteria. There are three equally weighted Assessment Criteria (Knowledge and Research, Critical Evaluation, Academic Communication). You can find out more about Schedule A by downloading this PDF but the important thing to help you interpret your feedback is the use of the verbal descriptors, i.e., the words like “excellent” and “good” used to describe different grades. You should look out for these words to help you understand how you performed on each ILO.\n\n7.13.2 Can I get more feedback?\nYou are more than welcome to receive additional feedback after the marking process:\n\nIf you would like to discuss your feedback you should first contact the person that marked your assignment. However, we ask that you wait 24 hours after the release of the feedback before you do so to give you time to fully reflect on the feedback given.\nWhen meeting with the person who marked your assignment, you can discuss feedback and how it relates to your overall grade to help you improve in future assignments. However, do not be worried about attending to discuss how to maintain your standard if you have done better than you expected. You are more than welcome to come discuss any aspect of your feedback or the assignment in general.\nTo help any discussion about your feedback, we would ask that you complete the reflection form available on the Moodle page and send that to the person who marked your assignment as part of the discussion, when arranging a meeting.\n\n7.13.3 How will feedback from this assessment help me in the future?\nThe feedback on this assessment will help you in writing future research reports, such as the qualitative report in semester 2, your MSc dissertation, and in any future research work you conduct that requires academic writing and evidence-based evaluation.\n\n7.13.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe first marker for your report will be a member of the Research Methods 1 team within the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\nFollowing University’s policy, as part of the marking procedures, the assignment marking will be moderated. The moderator will be another member of the research methods team who will moderate a range of work from across the cohort to ensure that appropriate academic standards have been applied in marking the assignments and that they have been applied consistently across the cohort of students being assessed.\n\n7.13.5 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded. That said, even if you are unhappy with your grade, your first point of contact should be to arrange an additional feedback meeting with your marker for further discussion to help explain your feedback and grade. Following this, if you still have concerns you should consult the guidance from the SRC which provides a clear explanation of the University appeals procedures."
