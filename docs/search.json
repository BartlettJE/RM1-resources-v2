You do not have to use all the different sources of support, and some will work better for you than others will. Part of learning is about finding what helps you best. Below are a few of the main approaches we have on this course to help you and if in doubt, please just ask:\n\nWeekly lab sessions with your tutor with time for questions in each lab;\nGraduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) support sessions in-person and online;\nTeams channel for discussion, questions, and support;\nStudent Office Hours (sometimes called Student Drop-in Hours) - just turn up and ask anything;\nAssessment information sheets and common questions and answer documents to support assignments.\n\nThe best approach is to write down your questions when they come up, check the available material for answers, and if you are still unsure after that, use one of the approaches above.\nHowever, please note we would ask that you do not send questions, either about a topic or an assignment, as a direct message on Teams to an individual staff member. While we always want to help, this approach is not sustainable and there is a highly likely chance your question will get missed and go unanswered. We would strongly encourage you to post the question on the course Team channel, as that way staff and students have the opportunity to answer your question, and other students can benefit from the answer. Alternatively, use the student office hours or your lab sessions to ask questions more privately.",

These walk through learning R/RStudio and applying data skills such as wrangling data, visualisation, and inferential statistics. However, we appreciate you may have questions or encounter errors you cannot work out on your own. That is why we schedule weekly support sessions with our GTAs.\nThe GTA support sessions are drop-in sessions, meaning they are not timetabled classes you must attend. They are there to go to if you have a problem, and you can come and ask questions. Our GTAs may demonstrate techniques or how to fix problems, but they are not intended to be chapter walkthroughs. The idea is you engage in self-directed study, and then you can come to the support sessions if you encounter problems.\nEarly in the semester, the support sessions have open invites. This means anyone can drop in and there might be a handful of students present and asking questions. However, as we approach key assessment periods, the sessions will have specific sign up slots to ensure the GTAs can provide clearly defined equitable time to each sign-up.",

We work through chapters 1 to 11 in RM1, then you will continue with chapters 12 to 14 in RM2.\nData skills takes time and trial and error to learn. We direct you to one or two chapters per week to develop your initial skills. Each chapter has a range of “try this” activities to apply what you learnt and check your answers against solutions. We also have “error mode” activities to get you used to making errors in coding. This can be the most intimidating part of learning to code but experienced coders do not stop making mistakes, they just get better at diagnosing and fixing their mistakes. Finally, we have data analysis journey chapters. These provide longer less structured activities to get you wrangling, visualising, and/or analysing data sets. These are meant as the bridge between the core chapters to your assessments where you no longer have solutions to check your answers against.",

    "text": "3.1 Graduate destinations\nAt the start of your degree, we recommend pretending you are looking for a job tomorrow. You are not locked into a decision but looking early means you can explore what essential and desirable criteria they list on person specifications. If you wanted that job tomorrow and you do not possess several criteria, your odds of getting an interview are slimmer. However, if check the criteria a year in advance of when you are applying for jobs, it gives you the time to develop your skills and knowledge for when you will be in that position.\nFor some resources, the British Psychology Society (BPS) outline career options in psychology. Predictably, they are psychology-focused and the odds are you are at least interested in a psychology career if you enrolled in this degree. However, a sizable number of graduates do not work in psychology once they graduate. The BPS career destinations survey (2017) reported that 67% of respondents needed a psychology degree for their current job, while 60% had a job in the field of psychology. On the other hand, a Jisc and Prospects report (2024) on what graduates do reported a much wider range of jobs. The highest percentage (page 96) for graduates with a psychology degree include childcare, health, and education; legal, social, and welfare; clerical, secretarial, and numerical clerks; health professionals; and smaller numbers of business, HR, and science professionals.\nA psychology degree can take you lots of places within and outside the field of psychology, so it is important you can identify the skills and knowledge you have. Before we move onto graduate attributes and skills/knowledge mapping, one thing to keep in mind is your position as an MSc conversion students. You simply do not have the time to reach the depth and breadth in one year that an undergraduate can achieve in three or four years. However, your unique selling point will be your combination of the conversion degree with your previous degree and experience. Many of our MSc conversion students have already completed years in the workplace, so keep this in mind when job criteria ask for related work experience.",

    "text": "3.3 Skills and knowledge mapping from RM1\nFor graduate level jobs, most of the person specification criteria are split into four sections:\n\nEducation\nExperience\nKnowledge\nSkills/abilities\n\nFor example, if you look at jobs.ac.uk for psychology jobs, they are mainly academic roles where you would be in the position to apply for something like a research assistant as you graduate. They would ask for a psychology degree (or related) under education, relevant experience such as working with patients/participants, relevant knowledge dependent on the role like research design or neurodiversity, and skills/abilities such as computer skills, data analysis software, and writing skills.\nIn RM1, we break the course down into three types of skills: subject knowledge, research skills, and data skills. Note the items within each type of skills is a non-exhaustive list for demonstration purposes. As you move through RM1 (and other courses on the degree), we recommend keeping a note of everything you do to refer back to once you start applying for jobs.\n\nFor example, you will learn about research design and statistics for subject knowledge, literature review tools and reference managers for research skills, and using R/RStudio to wrangle, visualise, and analysis data for data skills.\nWe can further break things down for what skills and knowledge you will learn and develop by completing each assessment on the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment\nSubject knowledge\nResearch skills\nData skills\n\n\n\nMCQ\nResearch design; Measurement; Probability; Philosophy of science; Metascience; Statistics\nEthics\nRStudio functionality\n\n\nData skills 1\nStatistics\n\nReproducible workflows; Data wrangling; Data visualisation\n\n\nData skills 2\nStatistics\n\nReproducible workflows; Data wrangling; Data visualisation; Data analysis\n\n\nStage One Group Report\nResearch design; Measurement; Subject-specific domain knowledge; Statistics\nEthics; Literature reviewing; Critical evaluation; Academic communication; Computer skills; Team work\n\n\n\nStage Two Individual Report\nResearch design; Measurement; Subject-specific domain knowledge; Probability; Statistics\nLiterature reviewing; Critical evaluation; Academic communication; Computer skills\nReproducible workflows; Data wrangling; Data visualisation; Data analysis",

BPS accredited undergraduate degree in Psychology (desirable).\n\nThis post is multi-disciplinary, so they invite candidates from a range of subjects. However, a BPS-accredited degree is listed as desirable, so the skills and subject knowledge are beneficial. Keep in mind sometimes people do not quite know how to classify an MSc conversion degree, so you can explain in the cover letter your degree provided BPS-accreditation.\n\nUnderstanding of behavioural research methods and questionnaire design and analysis.\n\nIn RM1, you learn about different quantitative research methods and designing/analysing questionnaire data for your research report. Supplementing this with RM2 and your dissertation would tick off this criterion.\n\nKnowledge of theories and research in traffic and transport psychology and/or behavioural change.\n\nThis is where the specification is asking for subject-specific domain knowledge. You would need to demonstrate this from another course, previous degree, upskilling, or your dissertation if the topic fits.\n\nAn awareness of ethical considerations for conducting research and knowledge of the BPS Code of Human Research Ethics.\n\nWe cover BPS human research ethics on RM1, so you would be able to demonstrate this in addition to RM2 and your dissertation.\n\nCompetence with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint\n\nIn RM1, you will mainly use Word and R Markdown for your stage one and stage two research reports. For data skills, you should have a basic understanding of spreadsheets but you might need to supplement this with further learning about Excel. For example, the university supports Coursera and LinkedIn learning courses if you need to upskill in Excel. We do not cover presentations in RM1, so you would need to demonstrate PowerPoint skills through other courses, previous experience, or upskilling.\n\nGood writing skills\n\nIn RM1, you will demonstrate good writing skills via your stage one and stage two report. You will then supplement this with essays, reports, and your dissertation elsewhere in the degree.\n\nBibliographic research skills\n\nTo support your research report, we cover literature review skills and using a reference manager within RM1. You will also be able to demonstrate this through other essays, reports, and your dissertation elsewhere in the degree.\n\nTime management and organisation of research/teaching schedules\n\nRM1 is a large course with several assessments, combined with all your other courses and commitments. So, you would be able to mention managing multiple assessments and courses in your degree. For organising research/teaching schedules, this will be related to your dissertation and previous/future experience as this job role has potential teaching responsibilities.\n\nConfident communication styles\n\nWe already covered writing skills but oral communication is not something you would be able to demonstrate from RM1 specific to assessments. The stage one report does involve team work though, so you would able to link in communicating and problem-solving with a diverse group.\n\nCompetence with standard analytical packages, such as R Studio (Desirable)\n\nIt is a desirable criterion but this position specifically mentions using RStudio. We directly cover data skills using R/RStudio so you would be able to tick this off alongside RM2 and your dissertation.\n\nCompetence with Adobe software including Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects (Desirable).\n\nIt is a desirable criterion but this is not something we cover on the degree. So, you would need to upskill yourself and maybe you have experience using Photoshop from a previous degree or job role. This is a pretty unusual request for a psychology research assistant position, so this is where as an MSc conversion student your previous degree or work experience might occasionally provide a unique selling point.\n\nExperience in presenting to an audience\n\nWe do not cover presentations on RM1, so you will need other courses involving presentations and previous/future experience to tick off this criterion.\n\nExperience in conducting and management at least one project, collecting and analysing data, and writing a report.\n\nIn RM1, you plan a research project in a team for your stage one report, and analyse data and write a stage two report. You will also write a full research report in RM2. You will not collect data yourself in RM1, but you will for your dissertation if you use primary data.",

This does not need to be a live meeting but stay connected regularly.\nDON’T: Commit to meetings/time frames that will not work for your timetable or work schedule.\n\nAgree on document collaboration platforms\n\nDO: We recommend having a shared OneDrive folder or sharing documents within your Teams channel using the files tab.\nDO: Use track changes and comments on shared documents.\nDO: Think about a shared Zotero, EndNote, or similar reference manager to organise papers.\n\nWork back from the deadline to create milestones\n\nDO: Be mindful of your work/life balance and upcoming busy periods.\nDO: Agree on specific dates to complete your responsibilities.\nDON’T: Leave things to the last minute.\n\nDetermine strengths and assign roles\n\nDO: Consult the Stage one group work planning advice section below to identify the strengths/preferences of your team.\n\nAssign tasks/milestones to roles\n\nDO: Attach names and dates to tasks and assign milestones using the Microsoft Planner template.\nDO: Reassign tasks/adjust deadlines as the project progresses if you need to.\nDON’T: Assign time-sensitive roles that might clash with someone’s known upcoming commitments.\n\nCommunicate, communicate, communicate\n\nDO: Check-in regularly.\nDO: Agree to action points at the end of meetings and put these in writing (e.g., in a shared document / to-do list).\nDO: Let your group know if you are struggling with a task/milestone.\nDO: Be kind and compassionate (to yourself and others).\nDON’T: Take things personally. We all know text/online communication can sound differently from how it is intended.\n\nSubmit your Assessment\n\nDO: Assign one person to prepare and submit the final documents when everyone has approved them. Remember to turn off track changes.\nDO: Give yourself time to look at the Turnitin Report.\nDON’T: Forget to check you are uploading the correct intended file.\n\n4.3.2 Points about inclusivity\nLanguage: Many/most students in this programme are studying in their second, third, or even fourth language. Consider the challenges you might experience if you were studying beyond your first language and be mindful of making implicit judgements about someone’s writing or communication.\nTiming/working patterns: Be mindful that everyone’s work/life balance and commitments are different. Some people prefer studying during traditional working hours, some in the evenings, and others on weekends. Communicate your preferences openly and as a group be as flexible and accommodating as you can. Can the times/days of meetings be flexible if this helps everyone contribute and feel engaged?\nTechnology: The technology/platforms we recommend might not be your favourites, but we recommend them for a reason. These are things we can directly support, and they are the things that we make sure all students in different countries can access. Using some apps/tools can explicitly exclude some members that want to engage and contribute.\nNeurodiversity: Different people work and think in different ways. If someone discloses that they find particular things challenging, or that they are at their best with a particular type of task or activity, consider how you can support/reflect this in the allocation of roles and tasks.\n\n4.3.3 Supporting self-efficacy/group dynamics\nOstracism: Group dynamics can be one of the trickiest things to manage in a project, especially if you feel like you are the “new person” coming into an established group. For the sake of everyone and your project, avoid implicitly or explicitly creating an in-group/out-group situation and ostracising people.\nPositivity: Try to maintain a positive tone about the project, even if you find it challenging. There is a fine line between having a little vent/catharsis and creating an atmosphere of toxic negativity. Some team members might take this to heart more than others and become dispirited about the activity, their abilities, and the completion of the task. If you are feeling frustrated or finding a particular thing challenging, talk to your group and consider seeking advice or support from the teaching team.\nImposter syndrome: It does not matter how we might be coping, sometimes it is impossible to avoid feeling like you or your work might not be good enough. If you are anxious about sharing something with your group, seek feedback from someone you trust first for their advice. Do not be afraid to make mistakes. Think about your shared documents as ‘working drafts’. Do not think you have to be anything other than who you are with your group. The pressure of thinking you must pretend to be a “model” student or meet the perceived expectations of others can get in the way of your being able to contribute your unique skills and experience.",

    "text": "4.4 Stage one group work task sharing advice\nAs you start working in your groups, one key decision will be sharing out the tasks equitably. In the stage one report template, there are several sections and sub-sections to complete. For each component, try to summarise the following when you first meet with your group:\n\nWhat information have you already established in that section?\nWhat do you still need to think about for that section?\nHow are you going to find answers to the things you do not yet know?\n\nFor example, you might say for the rationale, research question, and hypothesis component of the introduction:\n\nWhat have you already established?: So far, we know the research question and the hypothesis, and we have a general summary of relevant papers written by the team.\nWhat do we still need to think about?: We do not yet have a fully formed rationale or a solid understanding of the general overview.\nHow will you find answers to things you do not yet know? Helena, James, and Ashley will read the papers that have already been collected and the general literature review. From there, they will try to summarise the rationale so that it builds on what previous research has found. They will then present that to the group for further revision and discussion.\n\nOnce you have done that for each section, go through and answer the following question: Who will lead on each section?\nEach group member should make an equal contribution, but this does not mean every group member works on every section. Some sections might work better with one person leading and another editing, while other sections might work better with several people leading and editing.\nThe introduction is a larger section with fewer clearly segmented tasks, whereas the method is shorter with clearly defined sub-sections. It is important you understand all aspects of the prospect, so we recommend if you work on writing the introduction, you edit or at least proof-read the method, and vice versa.\nFor example, you might separate the tasks as:\n\nIntroduction literature review: Phil, Helena, and Ashley will lead on this section.\nIntroduction rationale, research question, and hypothesis: Helena, James, and Ashley will lead on this section.\nMethod participants: James and Phil will lead on this section.\nMethod materials: James and Wil will lead on this section.\nMethod procedure: Ashley and Sarune will lead on this section.\nMethod design and data analysis: Sarune and Wil will lead on this section.\n\nYou might choose to separate the tasks differently, but this is one suggestion to work through. We support this the Planner template for the stage one group report, so we recommend at least starting with this plan and allocate roles, and then adapt as you need.\nFor this separation or another approach you agree in your group, question what you know, what you still need to think about, and how you will fill in the blanks:\nIntroduction literature review\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nIntroduction rationale, research question, and hypothesis\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod participants\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod materials\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod procedure\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod design and data analysis\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nWho will lead on each section?\n\nIntroduction literature review:\nIntroduction rationale, research question, and hypothesis:\nMethod participants:\nMethod materials:\nMethod procedure:\nMethod design and data analysis:\n\nYou can either copy and adapt these questions to work on in your own document, copy the Planner template to your own Microsoft University account, or download this template to structure your group discussions.",

The university has a responsibility to ensure that students acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and other competencies associated within their discipline. The Student Learning Development service provides general guidance and support for students on the use of generative AI, but each item of assessment in your courses will have specific generative AI guidance about use and misuse in place. Where generative AI restrictions are in place, they have been carefully designed to maximise your learning opportunity whilst discouraging reliance on generative AI in a way that undermines your learning, or development of good professional practice and graduate attributes.\nStatement on use of generative AI: The current assessment is summative, meaning that it contributes to your course grade. The generative AI use for this assessment is categorised as amber and use of generative AI is allowed for some tasks during the preparation of the assessment.\nThere is no expectation that you will use generative AI and we have no evidence that it’s use will confer an advantage for this assessment. The purpose of this assessment is to encourage continuous learning over the semester and check your understanding in a low-stakes assessment. The MCQ has a low course grade percentage to reduce pressure and let you focus on learning. Taking short-cuts now will not provide an accurate overview of your understanding and skill development.\nIf you do use generative AI tools, we recommend using it for the following (non-exhaustive) kind of tasks:\n\nClarify complex concepts and reinforce understanding around intended learning outcomes.\nPlan a revision schedule.\nGenerate practice quizzes and questions.\n\nIf you do use generative AI tools, we strongly recommend not using it for the following (non-exhaustive) kind of tasks:\n\nRelying on AI tools for understanding key concepts.\nHelping you to answer the questions.",

All the assignments build on each other and information within the formative assignments will help to complete the summative assignments.\nUse the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis data skills book activities to guide you. In almost all cases (apart from where we highlight), the answers to the assignments require using skills that you have already covered in these materials.\nAvoid making changes to the .Rmd file other than to provide answers and your GUID (e.g., avoid deleting backticks, changing code chunk names, not using the file provided). If you edit the file in a way that affects how the .Rmd knits, such as deleting backticks or changing code chunk names, your submission may be invalid and be returned with a H grade.\nPlease pay special attention if the question asks for a specific output, e.g. value or a data_frame. For example, when asked for a value as an output, make sure it is a single value and not a value stored in a data frame. Finally, when altering code inside the code blocks, do not re-order, rename, or remove the code blocks (e.g. T01, T02, etc.). If you do, this will impact your grade and may result in you receiving a H grade for this assignment. If you are unsure about any of these points, please ask a member of staff.\nRead the question carefully and ensure that you provide exactly what we ask you (e.g., code or a single value). Do not deviate from what the question asks. We encourage you to practice different approaches in your own time, but for these assignments you should only do what the questions ask.\nTest that the .Rmd file you are submitting is reproducible after completing it, by “knitting” it as a html file. This also shows what you have accomplished and allows you to spot potential errors. If your code does not knit, this may result in you receiving an H grade for this assignment, so please check carefully.\nA great test of your code is to close R Studio, restart it, open and knit your code, see that it runs, and go through it to make sure you consider the answers to be correct. This will test whether you have remembered to include essential elements, such as libraries, in your code. This does not necessarily mean that your code is correct, only that your code runs. You need to check the output and compare to the question to see that it matches.\nWhen loading in data, you must use a relative path as opposed to an absolute path. Relative would mean having the data file in the same folder as the .Rmd file and just calling the data file when reading it in, e.g. read_csv(\"data.csv\"). Absolute would be using a path specific to the folder structure of your computer, e.g. read_csv(\"C:/JamesComputer/JamesFolder/data.csv\"). Only use relative paths and under no circumstances should you rename the data file from the one we tell you to use. The file name “data.csv” is different from “data (1).csv” and “data_1.csv”. Only use the name we give you.\nThe following functions are considered forbidden and must not appear anywhere in your code at all. Inclusion of them in your code may result in you receiving a H grade for the assignment. The functions are: install.packages(), help(), vignette(), setwd(),help.start(), or View().\nCollate your notes and learn from your mistakes. These assignments are weighted low to give you the space to make mistakes and to not have a major impact on your overall course grade. Try and take advantage of this opportunity to test your skill development and prepare you for the larger report components and your future dissertation.",

    "text": "6.10 Feedback information\n\n6.10.1 How is this assessment graded?\nEach data skills assignment will have several questions with each question being worth either 1 or 2 points. Your grade will be converted into an alphanumeric grade on the standard Glasgow 22-point Schedule A scale (e.g., a score of 16 = B2).\n\n6.10.2 How will the feedback from this assessment help me in the future?\nThe practical data skills assignments will help you develop your transferable data skills to complete future work that requires working with data, such as your dissertation, and courses or jobs that require such skills. Additionally, as you will see, these skills can be used for tasks such as writing reports, creating reference sections, conducting text analyses and building websites, as well as a wealth of other tasks and is therefore an extremely useful transferable skill. These skills also give you a much deeper understanding of data and research.\n\n6.10.3 What type of feedback will I receive for this assessment?\nFor these assignments, you will get a feedback sheet for each assignment that tells you whether you received full, partial, or no credit for each task/question within the assignment.\nYou will receive individual feedback on each task within an assignment, telling you where your answer was acceptable or telling you what was incorrect about your answer. You will also see the correct answer to each task within an assignment along with a short piece of generic feedback for that task.\nWe will also make a solution to the assignment available that you should compare to your own work to see alternative approaches, or to see where you have gone wrong, and to see what you have done correctly.\n\n6.10.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe assignments will be graded by an experienced member of staff using computer-assisted marking. Note that this is not automated marking as the member of staff has the final say on all submitted answers and checks the process at every step. In the first instance, we compare the output of your answer to the expected output or the code used to the code requested. If these comparisons match then you are given full credit for the task. If your answer does not match what was asked for in the task, then the member of staff manually checks your output to the expected output, or your code to the expected code, and to the question asked, to see if your code/output still answers the question or not. A decision is then made on whether to award full, partial, or no credit for that task.\n\n6.10.5 Can I get more feedback?\nYes! We encourage you discuss your assessment first with the marker or course lead (regardless of what grade you received) and you can do so either by messaging the marker or course lead directly to arrange an appointment. You can also speak to the GTA team about your coding skills for further development. All staff contact details can be found on the University of Glasgow directory.\n\n6.10.6 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded. That said, even if you are unhappy with your grade, your first point of contact should be to arrange an additional feedback meeting with your marker for further discussion to help explain your feedback and grade. Following this, if you still have concerns you should consult the guidance from the SRC which provides a clear explanation of the University appeals procedures.",

There are three equally weighted Assessment Criteria (Knowledge and Research, Critical Evaluation, Academic Communication). You can find out more about Schedule A by downloading this PDF but the important thing to help you interpret your feedback is the use of the verbal descriptors, i.e., the words like “excellent” and “good” used to describe different grades. You should look out for these words to help you understand how you performed on each ILO.\n\n7.13.2 Can I get more feedback?\nYou are more than welcome to receive additional feedback after the marking process:\n\nIf you would like to discuss your feedback you should first contact the person that marked your assignment. However, we ask that you wait 24 hours after the release of the feedback before you do so to give you time to fully reflect on the feedback given.\nWhen meeting with the person who marked your assignment, you can discuss feedback and how it relates to your overall grade to help you improve in future assignments. However, do not be worried about attending to discuss how to maintain your standard if you have done better than you expected. You are more than welcome to come discuss any aspect of your feedback or the assignment in general.\nTo help any discussion about your feedback, we would ask that you complete the reflection form available on the Moodle page and send that to the person who marked your assignment as part of the discussion, when arranging a meeting.\n\n7.13.3 How will feedback from this assessment help me in the future?\nPrimarily, the feedback on this assessment will help support the analysis and write-up of the stage two individual report in this course. Additionally, the feedback will help support your qualitative report in RM2, as well as your dissertation and in any future research work you conduct that requires data analysis, decision-making, and evidence-based justification.\n\n7.13.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe first marker for your report will be a member of the Research Methods 1 team within the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\nFollowing University’s policy, as part of the marking procedures, the assignment marking will be moderated. The moderator will be another member of the research methods team who will moderate a range of work from across the cohort to ensure that appropriate academic standards have been applied in marking the assignments and that they have been applied consistently across the cohort of students being assessed.\n\n7.13.5 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded.

The university has a responsibility to ensure that students acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and other competencies associated within their discipline. The Student Learning Development service provides general guidance and support for students on the use of generative AI, but each item of assessment in your courses will have specific generative AI guidance about use and misuse in place. Where generative AI restrictions are in place, they have been carefully designed to maximise your learning opportunity whilst discouraging reliance on generative AI in a way that undermines your learning, or development of good professional practice and graduate attributes.\nStatement on use of generative AI: The current assessment is summative, meaning that it contributes to your course grade. The generative AI use for this assessment is categorised as amber and use of generative AI is allowed for some tasks during the preparation of the assessment.\nThere is no expectation that you will use generative AI and we have no evidence that its use will confer an advantage for this assessment. If you do use generative AI, please clearly acknowledge its use in-text via citations and referencing and in an appendix with a declaration of AI use as appropriate – please see the title page on Moodle for further instructions. If you choose to use it, we recommend that you use the Microsoft Edge browser with Copilot and sign into your university account using the two-factor authentication to ensure that your work is private and secure. Please keep a log of all AI use.\nThe purpose of this assessment is to work on your quantitative research methods skills and your understanding of a research project from communicating your findings to putting your results in context. The stage two report is the culmination of your skill development in RM1, as you are applying your data wrangling, visualisation, and analysis skills, plus your subject knowledge and research skills for writing the results and discussion. You will write whole reports in RM2 and your dissertation, so this is the chance to develop your own skills. Any short-cuts you take now will have a knock-on effect in future. So, try and embrace the skill development component to the course and assessment.\nIf you do use generative AI tools, we recommend using it for the following (non-exhaustive) kind of tasks:\n\nClarify complex concepts and reinforce understanding around intended learning outcomes.\nPlan a structure for your assessment.\nRecommend keywords and other tips for effective literature searches.\nHelp debug code by working out the source of errors.\nAssist with referencing format.\n\nIf you do use generative AI tools, we strongly recommend not using it for the following (non-exhaustive) kind of tasks:\n\nConducting your whole literature review for you, as you may miss out on potentially useful sources and AI tools are notorious for making up references.\nWrite whole paragraphs or sections of your report for you.\nConduct your whole data analysis or generate summaries of data for you.\nRewrite bulleted lists or notes into sentences and paragraphs.",

There are three equally weighted Assessment Criteria (Knowledge and Research, Critical Evaluation, Academic Communication). You can find out more about Schedule A by downloading this PDF but the important thing to help you interpret your feedback is the use of the verbal descriptors, i.e., the words like “excellent” and “good” used to describe different grades. You should look out for these words to help you understand how you performed on each ILO.\n\n8.13.2 Can I get more feedback?\nYou are more than welcome to receive additional feedback after the marking process:\n\nIf you would like to discuss your feedback you should first contact the person that marked your assignment. However, we ask that you wait 24 hours after the release of the feedback before you do so to give you time to fully reflect on the feedback given.\nWhen meeting with the person who marked your assignment, you can discuss feedback and how it relates to your overall grade to help you improve in future assignments. However, do not be worried about attending to discuss how to maintain your standard if you have done better than you expected. You are more than welcome to come discuss any aspect of your feedback or the assignment in general.\nTo help any discussion about your feedback, we would ask that you complete the reflection form available on the Moodle page and send that to the person who marked your assignment as part of the discussion, when arranging a meeting.\n\n8.13.3 How will feedback from this assessment help me in the future?\nThe feedback on this assessment will help you in writing future research reports, such as the qualitative report in semester 2, your MSc dissertation, and in any future research work you conduct that requires academic writing and evidence-based evaluation.\n\n8.13.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe first marker for your report will be a member of the Research Methods 1 team within the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\nFollowing University’s policy, as part of the marking procedures, the assignment marking will be moderated. The moderator will be another member of the research methods team who will moderate a range of work from across the cohort to ensure that appropriate academic standards have been applied in marking the assignments and that they have been applied consistently across the cohort of students being assessed.\n\n8.13.5 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded. That said, even if you are unhappy with your grade, your first point of contact should be to arrange an additional feedback meeting with your marker for further discussion to help explain your feedback and grade. Following this, if you still have concerns you should consult the guidance from the SRC which provides a clear explanation of the University appeals procedures.",

    "text": "9.1 General overview of the registered report\nIn this course, we are preparing you to read/appraise journal articles, know how to conduct your own project, and write up an empirical quantitative research project. Throughout the lectures, labs, and independent learning, you will learn how to formulate a research question, design a study, apply statistical analyses, and write up your results to communicate to others as a research report.\nIn your group, you will decide on a topic and collectively write a stage one registered report (see the stage one AIS) which contains an introduction and method section for how you plan on addressing your research question. Individually, you will then write a stage two registered report (see the stage two AIS) which contains a results, discussion, and abstract section. You have more than enough to learn about in this course without worrying about designing a study, applying for ethics, and collecting data yourselves. Therefore, we have developed two projects for you and your group to choose from and pick your own adventure.\nOne project focuses on sustainability and the other project focuses on inclusion/belonging. The British Psychological Society (BPS) identified both of these topics as two key areas that psychology graduates can contribute to for evidence-based understanding, policy, and intervention. As psychology students, you will learn about research methods and statistics with an applied focus, to robustly and reproducibly address research questions relevant to psychology.\nWe have already designed and prepared the projects you will work with in your groups. You will write a stage one and stage two registered report from the perspective of the researcher as if you conducted the studies yourselves, but you will only help us to collect data and add to the participant pool. This reduces pressure and gives you time to focus on learning about research methods and statistics before you design your own studies in future courses and in your dissertation. Autonomy is important in education though, so you have the choice between two projects to decide on as a group, and within each project there is flexibility in the research questions you can develop.\nThe rest of this chapter outlines starter packs to learn more about the two projects and give you a starting point for your research, so please read through in advance of your first lab.",

    "text": "9.2 Sustainability starter pack\n\n9.2.1 Study background\nEating meat is a key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. One potential low cost intervention to reduce meat eating is using dynamic norms in the messaging behind adopting more sustainable behaviours. A dynamic norm is where you highlight the change of a norm over time, such as more people recently changing their behaviour to eat less meat. In contrast, a static norm describes it’s current state. Sparkman & Walton (2017) demonstrated that dynamic norms would lead to greater intention to eat less meat than static norms. However, studies like Aldoh et al. (2024) have struggled to replicate the finding and question whether it translates to actual behaviour.\nIn our study, we include items on meat eating for a replication of previous work on the effect of dynamic norms but we also offer an extension opportunity to explore the effect of dynamic norms on alternative types of sustainable behaviour like using public transport and reusable cups/bottles.\n\n9.2.2 Why is this topic important?\nThe BPS highlight the role of psychology research in responding to challenges/opportunities relating to the United Nation’s (UN) sustainable development goals. Psychologists have the tools to conduct research to inform evidence-based policy and interventions in addressing these goals. The goals most relevant to this project are 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 13 (climate action).\n\n9.2.3 Relevant theory\nOne popular theory relating to behaviour change is the COM-B model of behaviour (Michie et al., 2011). The aim of this theory is to explain why a specific behavior occurs and how to create interventions that lead to effective change in that behaviour. COM-B stands for capability (C), opportunity (O), and motivation (M), relating to a given behaviour (B). Ask yourselves the following questions:\n\nHow well regarded is the COM-B model? Does empirical evidence generally support it as a theory of human behaviour?\nHow might the COM-B model apply to understanding adopting more sustainable behaviours such as meat eating, using public transport, and using reusable cups/bottles?\nBased on the theory, what kind of effect from dynamic norms do you predict to find?\n\n9.2.4 Research design\nYou will be unfamiliar with a lot of this terminology at the start of the course, but we outline it nice and early to help refine your research question and know what variables you will have available since you did not design the study yourself.\nThere is one independent variable with two levels. We randomise participants into one of two groups: they receive a dynamic norm statement or they receive a static norm statement.\nThere are three potential dependent variables which measure interest in adopting a more sustainable behaviour. For this course, we heavily recommend choosing just one of the measures given the word count of the stage one and stage two registered report assessments. The three dependent variables are:\n\nHow interested are you in eating less meat? We measure this on a 0 (not at all interested) to 100 (extremely interested) scale.\nHow interested are you in using more public transport? We measure this on a 0 (not at all interested) to 100 (extremely interested) scale.\nHow interested are you in using a reusable cup or bottle for takeout purchases? We measure this on a 0 (not at all interested) to 100 (extremely interested) scale.\n\nWe then have a selection of others variables available for reporting or identifying a specific sample such as age, gender, vegetarian status, political position, student status, and self-reported data quality. You will see more information on the wording and options behind these variables in the code book and Qualtrics walkthrough.\n\n9.2.5 Potential research questions\nIn this introductory course, we focus on analysing research designs with two variables. Most relevant to this project is one independent variable (dynamic vs static norms) and one dependent variable of your choice from the three sustainable behaviours. For example, you might focus on a replication with a research question on eating meat like:\n\n“Do dynamic norms lead to greater intentions to eat less meat compared to static norms?”\n\nOn the other hand, you might explore one of the other dependent variables as an extension and develop a research question like:\n\n“Do dynamic norms lead to greater intentions to use more public transport compared to static norms?”\n\nWhile we focus on two variables for the design and analysis in this course, you could develop a more specific research question in your stage one report by identifying a specific sample/population:\n\n“Do dynamic norms lead to greater intentions to eat less meat compared to static norms in international students?”\n\nThese are only examples for inspiration and you are welcome to develop an alternative evidence-based research question in your groups providing it is possible within the constraints of the study design.",

First, you might be interested in the relationship between two variables, such as whether an increase in one variable is associated with an increase in another variable. Second, you might be interested in whether two groups differ on a given outcome.\nFor relationships, if you are thinking about which sub-scales might be correlated with each other or related, you might ask such research questions as:\n\nIs there a relationship between help-seeking and test anxiety?\nIs there an association between intrinsic goal orientation and effort regulation?\n\nIf you are thinking about which sub-scales might show group differences, you might ask such research questions as:\n\nDo mature students have lower test anxiety than traditional students?\nDo postgraduate students have higher intrinsic motivation than undergraduate students?\n\nWe will go into more detail about how to create formal research questions and hypotheses in future weeks. Starting in week 2, we will show you how to find peer-reviewed evidence to build your understanding of the variables, identify a rationale, and develop your research question and hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou will have freedom to develop a research question in your group but since you are using secondary data, there are constraints.

    "text": "9.6 MSLQ suggested variable pairs\nNow you have an understanding of what the MSLQ project is, we have a list of variable pairs that have worked well in the past and we know that there is some existing literature to base your study on. We would like you to read through these pairs for different types of designs you will learn about in the semester. When you complete the variable preference form, you will put your name down next to the pair you are most interested in, and we will use this to try and organise people into groups with similar interests. Just keep in mind we cannot always match people as there might be too many people with the same interests per lab, so there will still be an element of randomness to your groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I still change my mind?\n\n\n\nThis seems like a big decision to make so early, but we use your initial interests to arrange people into groups when you might not know other people in your lab yet. You can choose different variables once you are in your groups, but we outlined these as we know they can work well together for the report, and you must make any changes in collaboration with all the members of your group. Once you settle on two variables, you might also focus on a specific population in your group as you develop your rationale, like focusing on postgraduate students if you recognise there is a gap in the literature, so there is still creative freedom beyond choosing the variable pairs.\n\n\n\n9.6.1 Variable pairs for comparing two groups\n\nTest anxiety and undergraduate vs postgraduate, or years 1 and 2 vs years 3-5 (pre-honours vs honours at the University of Glasgow)\nHelp-seeking and first vs second language\nMeta-cognitive self-regulation and non-mature vs mature undergraduate student status\nMeta-cognitive self-regulation and undergraduate vs postgraduate study, or years 1 and 2 vs years 3-5 (pre-honours vs honours at the University of Glasgow)\nSelf-efficacy and undergraduate vs postgraduate study\nIntrinsic motivation and undergraduate vs postgraduate study\n\n9.6.2 Variable pairs for the association between two variables.\n\nSelf-efficacy and help-seeking\nTest anxiety and meta-cognitive self-regulation\nTest anxiety and self-efficacy\nSelf-efficacy and help-seeking\nIntrinsic motivation and age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry this\n\n\n\nNow you have read through the MSLQ and project overview, think about which variable pairs interest you the most and put your name down next to the pair that you want to start exploring on the variable interest form (available on Moodle).

    "text": "10.1.1 Identifying key words\nBefore you can read journal articles, you need to find them. The first step in a literature review is working out what your keywords will be. You will be looking in databases, so you need to select the appropriate terms to ensure your search results return the content you are looking for. It takes patience to identify and tweak the search terms that identify the content you are looking for. As a starting point, these might be your topic or variables.\nOnce you identify some useful articles, these can provide further inspiration and specificity. Many journal articles will give you a helping hand as the authors must provide several keywords relating to the article. For example, Figure 10.1 from Schroeder and Epley (2015) highlights the keywords that describe their article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Keywords on the front page of Schroeder and Epley (2015).\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of articles will post keywords under the abstract. Here, we can see there are seven words or short phrases that summarise the content of the article. Sometimes they are not truly relevant to the topic (e.g., open data here), so you will need to skim a few articles to recognise recurring themes and potentially useful keywords.\n\n10.1.2 Search strategies\nOnce you have some keywords, your next step will be to try and find more articles. The two main data bases you will use are the University of Glasgow library and Google Scholar.\nYou can access the University of Glasgow library through your student portal. This is the database that the university uses to pay for access to journal articles and ebooks. Glasgow has a huge number of journals available, so this will be one of your best resources as you may be asked to pay for articles if you access journal websites directly, never pay for articles though, there is always a way to find them. Google Scholar is also a valuable resource that can return different results. A combination of these two databases will be a good starting point for any essay or report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNever pay for journal articles. We have a huge library at Glasgow, so you will almost always find the article by searching for the title. If it is not available, then there are other strategies like searching the title on Google Scholar or regular Google and there might be a PDF someone has posted. Authors can often freely share an author manuscript (also known as a post-print) which contains the same text as the final article but without the fancy journal formatting.\n\n\nEnter your keywords in the search bar of these data bases. You can enter one word or phrase and the data base will try to locate resources that contain that word. For example, we might want to find additional articles investigating job candidates’ speech (Figure 10.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Searching for articles using one keyword.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is usually much more powerful to combine search terms to provide more precise results. If you enter single words or phrases, you might find there are thousands of results which contain mostly irrelevant articles. You can use two or more keywords to look for more specific articles (Figure 10.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Searching for articles using multiple keywords.\n\n\n\n\nHere, you can see we have used speech AND decision making AND hiring. The capitalised AND is called a Boolean operator. It is used to link together the three words. It means we only want articles that contain the three words. Not one of them, not two of them, but all three. Using AND narrows down your search. Alternatively, you can use OR which expands your search to look for two or more terms. AND will provide fewer results and OR will provide more. You can also use NOT to rule out particular terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can do this in the single search bar by entering the Boolean operators yourself. Alternatively, if you click advanced search, you can add search boxes and choose from AND, OR, and NOT for each term. You can also start to filter your results to only return results from a date range, if you only wanted articles from say the past 5 years.\n\n\nYou can also use Boolean operators in Google Scholar to combine the search terms gender AND “hiring decisions”. This means we only want search results that contain both elements (Figure 10.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: Using Boolean operators in Google Scholar.\n\n\n\n\nWe surround the phrase “Hiring decisions” with quotes. This forces databases to search for the specific phrase exactly as typed in the quotes. If we did not surround it by quotes, we can get search results that contain the words hiring and decisions separately or together. If they are separate, the results might not be quite what we are looking for.\nAs a final literature searching tip, once you find an article that is precisely on the topic you are searching for, you can look at articles in it’s reference list and at articles that have since cited it. This is no guarantee there will be something useful, but you can often benefit from the citation trees of your key articles.\nOn the library portal, you can see articles that your target articles cites, which will show the articles in its reference list that are readable by the library database (Figure 10.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Identifying articles that a target article cites in the library portal.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, on Google Scholar, you can look through the articles that have since cited your target article (Figure 10.6). You will get fewer hits for more recent articles as there has been less time for another article to be published, but its another useful strategy for identifying potentially useful articles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: Identifying articles that have since cited your target article in Google Scholar.\n\n\n\n\nFor further tips, see the University of Glasgow library guide on how to search for articles and a brief video navigating around the library search function.",

    "text": "10.2 Using a reference manager to store your results\nThroughout the programme, you must use APA 7th edition. Although you could download each article and manually enter the citation and reference list entries, there are more efficient ways to provide you with more time in other areas of your report or essay writing. A reference manager will help to keep your research organised and it will do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to entering citations and creating the reference list.\nOur recommendation is Zotero which you can download for free at https://www.zotero.org/. There are alternatives (such as EndNote which the university endorses as approved software), but most of the psychology team prefer Zotero. Under preferences, make sure you select APA 7th edition to format the citations and references correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs third-party software which requires you to create an account, we recommend not using the same password as your university account.\n\n\nUsing Zotero, you can:\n\nInstall a plugin to save articles you find through your web browser.\nIf there is an open access version of the article PDF, Zotero will automatically save it.\nManually upload PDFs and Zotero will try to find the key metadata such as the title, volume number etc.\nCreate folders to keep your research organised into folders, such as one for each assignment.\nCreate shared folders to add and access the same articles with people you are working with.\nCopy citation and reference lists into your assignment.\nUse the Zotero plugin in Word or Google Docs to enter citations and automatically create a reference list.\nAdd notes and highlights to each article you read within Zotero.\nSync your library across devices, so you can download articles on your laptop, but read the articles on your phone or tablet.\n\nJust keep in mind, Zotero cannot always find all the information or it gets some of the details wrong. So, you may have to manually enter/edit the details for the citation/reference to be formatted correctly. This is why it is still important to learn the key details of APA formatting, but you are using your understanding more efficiently to spot mistakes rather than manually format each entry in your assignment.\nIf you like to follow along to a video, there are some helpful resources on YouTube to guide you through a lot of the basics:\n\nMcGill University has a playlist of a short tutorials.\nThere are also longer tutorials working through the features of Zotero.\n\nThe Zotero website also has a quick start guide if you prefer a written explanation in addition to detailed documentation.",

    "section": "\n10.3 Reading journal articles",
    "text": "10.3 Reading journal articles\nNow you have one or two articles, the ability to read them might sound obvious, but research (e.g., Kershaw et al., 2018) consistently shows students find it difficult at first to summarise and critically evaluate empirical research. Our students have a range of backgrounds, so we want to make sure everyone has the skills to read and evaluate published research.\nJournal articles have a different structure and writing style than textbooks or news articles. Usually, they are not written to be a thrilling bedtime read. They can be quite dense with lots of technical jargon. This means - particularly early in your degree - you must be quite strategic in how you read journal articles.\nUntil you learn about different statistical tests, the introduction and discussion sections will be most accessible. The introduction provides the background to the study and outlines what the study is trying to achieve. The discussion recaps what results the authors think they found and puts them in context. As you progress through your research methods courses, you will understand more of the method and results.\n\n10.3.1 Types of Journal Article\nBefore we introduce the QALMRI method, it is important you recognise there are different types of journal article. The QALMRI method mainly applies to original quantitative research, so here is a list of common journal articles and types of research you may come across:\n\nOriginal research: quantitative studies: Potentially the most common type of research in psychology. These articles contain an individual study or a series of studies where the researchers collect numeric data to answer their research question. This is what we will focus on for this tutorial.\nOriginal research: qualitative studies: Some research follows a different methodological philosophy where they collect non-numerical data, such as identifying themes in forum posts. The QALMRI method would not totally apply here as qualitative research typically does not test hypotheses, but you would identify the authors’ broad and specific research questions and their important results.\nSystematic reviews and/or meta-analyses: Researchers may want to identify all the relevant articles on a topic and collate their findings. In a systematic review, the authors provide an overview of the findings in words. In a meta-analysis, the authors apply statistical techniques to calculate the average effect size across studies and how much the effect sizes vary.\nReview article: Instead of trying to identify all relevant articles in a systematic review, a review is less comprehensive. Researchers typically write review articles to explain a topic to readers or outline a theory.\nEditorials: Editors of a journal may write short introductions to a collection of articles they are publishing or announce a new policy for their journal.\nCommentary or opinion articles: Commentary or opinion articles allow authors to present their viewpoint on a topic, typically in response to another article. For example, if a set of authors disagree with the methods or interpretation of an original article, they can write a commentary or opinion article to explain why they disagree. ### The QALMRI Method\n\nOne evidenced-based strategy to learn how to read journal articles containing original quantitative research is known as the QALMRI (Question, Alternatives, Logic, Method, Results, and Inferences) method (Brosowsky et al., 2020). You can read more about the method on Crump’s (2018) Research Methods Lab Manual. When reading an article, try and answer the following questions:\nQuestions\n\nWhat was the broad question (the general topic of interest) being asked by this research project?\nWhat was the specific question (what this specific experiment will address) being asked by this research project?\n\nAlternatives\n\nWhat was the author’s hypothesis (the hypothesis they are testing)?\nWhat were the alternative hypotheses (what other explanations could there be that the authors ruled out)?\n\nLogic\n\nWhat was the logic of the hypothesis? i.e., if the hypothesis was true, what should we expect to happen?\n\nMethods\n\nBriefly describe the study design (i.e., experimental or correlational?) and sample.\nWhat were the variables? i.e., independent and dependent variables for experiments; variables for correlations.\nBriefly describe the study procedure in everyday terms.\n\nResults\n\nWhat were the important results?\n\nInferences\n\nWhat did the authors conclude from their study?\nHow did the authors use the results to make inferences and conclusions about the hypothesis and research question?\n\n10.3.2 The QALMRI Method in Action\nThe authors of the QALMRI method (Brosowsky & Parshina, 2017) provide a worked example in Appendix A so you can see what information you must identify in a journal article. The following answers are reproduced from Brosowsky and Parshina with some minor edits. They evaluated the study “Ecological validity of the testing effect: The use of daily quizzes in introductory Psychology” by Batsell et al. (2017):\n\n10.3.2.1 Questions\n\nWhat was the broad question (the general topic of interest) being asked by this research project?\n\nWhat kinds of teaching techniques will improve student learning in a classroom?\n\nWhat was the specific question (what this specific experiment will address) being asked by this research project?\n\nWill daily quizzes enhance retention of assigned study material?\n\n10.3.2.2 Alternatives\n\nWhat was the author’s hypothesis (the hypothesis they are testing)?\n\nHypothesis 1: Daily quizzes will improve memory for study material whether the material had appeared in a quiz or not.\n\nWhat were the alternative hypotheses (what other explanations could there be that the authors ruled out)?\n\nHypothesis 2: Daily quizzes will only improve memory for study material that appeared in the quizzes.\nHypothesis 3: Daily quizzes will not improve memory for study material.\n\n10.3.2.3 Logic\n\nWhat was the logic of the hypothesis? i.e., if the hypothesis was true, what should we expect to happen?\n\nIf hypothesis 1, then a quizzed group will perform better than a study-only group on a memory test for all the studied material.\nIf hypothesis 2, then a quizzed group will perform better than a study-only group on a memory test, but only for the material that appeared on the tests.\nIf hypothesis 3, then a quizzed group will not perform better than a study-only group on a memory test for the studied material. Note: In essence, this is the null hypothesis of no difference.\n\n10.3.2.4 Methods\n\nBriefly describe the study design (i.e., experimental or correlational?) and sample.\n\nThe study used a 2x3 factorial design (quasi-experimental). The sample included 64 university students from a range of levels in the authors’ department.\n\nWhat were the variables? i.e., independent and dependent variables for experiments; variables for correlations.\n\nIndependent Variable A: Class (study-only and quiz): - One class received daily quizzes while the other did not.\n\nThis variable is between-subjects and quasi-experimental (students were not randomly assigned to classes).\n\nIndependent Variable B: Question-Type (identical, similar, and new):\n\nMemory test questions were either identical to those used in the quizzes (identical), similar in content to those used in the quizzes (similar), or did not appear in the quizzes (new).\nThis variable is within-subjects and experimental (questions were randomly assigned to each condition).\n\nDependent Variable: Accuracy averaged across three memory tests.\n\nBriefly describe the study procedure in everyday terms.\n\nStudents enrolled in two Introduction to Psychology courses took part in the study. The participants were all assigned textbook readings which consisted of material not taught during the lectures. One class received daily quizzes (21 total), while the other did not. Memory was tested three times throughout the term using 15 multiple-choice questions. Test questions were either identical to the quiz questions (identical), similar in content to the quiz questions (similar), or questions that did not appear in the quizzes (new).\n\n10.3.2.5 Results\n\nWhat were the important results?\n\nThe Class x Question-Type ANOVA and follow-up t-tests show that the quiz group outperformed the study-only group on all three question types. However, this difference was greatest for identical questions (21.8%), then similar questions (17.6%), and smallest for new questions (12.7%).\nANOVAs with follow-up t-tests were also run separately on the quiz and study-only groups. The results for the study group showed no significant differences in performance across the identical (58.4%), similar (62.8%), and new (60.4%) question types. The results for the quiz group however, showed that performance for the identical (80.2%) and similar (80.4%) questions was significantly better than performance for the new questions (73.1%).\n\n10.3.2.6 Inferences\n\nWhat did the authors conclude from their study?\n\nThe results of the experiment show enhanced retention of studied material when participants were quizzed daily regardless of whether the study material was actually presented during the quizzes or not.\nThe authors conclude that they successfully replicated the testing effect, previously shown in laboratory settings, in a naturalistic classroom setting. Furthermore, they conclude that the testing benefit generalizes to non-quizzed material and therefore instructors do not need to quiz all of the study material to gain the testing effect benefit.\n\nHow did the authors use the results to make inferences and conclusions about the hypothesis and research question?\n\nThese results are consistent with the original hypothesis (Hypothesis 1) and suggest that periodic quizzes can enhance the retention of assigned material (specific question) and testing could be used as an effective teaching technique to improve student learning in a classroom setting (big question).\n\n10.3.3 Exercise: Applying the QALMRI Method\nNow you have read about the QALMRI method and saw how you can answer the 11 questions based on the information in a journal article, it is time to practice yourself on a new article.\nPieger et al. (2018) is available open access through the journal Frontiers in Education. They studied the disfluency effect: the idea that writing information in a harder to read font requires greater concentration which can lead to improved recall when quizzed on the topic. Read through the article and try to answer the questions from the QALMRI method. The activity below is based on downloading the article as a PDF to see page numbers, but you could check your understanding of the QALMRI questions using either the web or PDF version.\nEach question has two elements: the page number that includes the information and a hidden solution providing a longer explanation. Make sure you attempt each question on your own first and then check you identified the correct information by looking at the solution.\n\n10.3.3.1 Questions\n\nWhat was the broad question (the general topic of interest) being asked by this research project?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the middle left of page 2, their broad question can best be described as “is disfluency a desirable difficulty and does it activate analytic monitoring?”.\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the specific question (what this specific experiment will address) being asked by this research project? There are two research questions the authors are interested in here, but they are both on the same page.\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bottom right of page 3, their specific research questions are helpfully in the research questions sub-section. They are asking two questions: (1) does viewing disfluent then fluent test activiate analytic monitoring and (2) does viewing fluent then disfluent text activate surface level monitoring?\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3.2 Alternatives\n\nWhat was the author’s hypothesis (the hypothesis they are testing)?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bottom right of page 3, hypothesis 1: when participants view disfluent then fluent texts, they expect no difference between disfluent text and fluent text on their outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nWhat were the alternative hypotheses (what other explanations could there be that the authors ruled out)?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bottom right of page 3, hypothesis 2: when participants view fluent then disfluent texts, they expect the outcomes such as ease of learning to be lower for disfluent text than fluent text. Note: This is slightly different to the previous example. Pieger et al. (2018) did not outline competing hypotheses, they just outlined their predictions in two parts for each presentation order.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3.3 Logic\n\nWhat was the logic of the hypothesis? i.e., if the hypothesis was true, what should we expect to happen? There is no page number to identify here, you just need outline what results would support each hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor hypothesis 1, there will be no difference in the dependent variables between disfluent text and fluent text when participants are shown the materials in the disfluent then fluent order.\nFor hypothesis 2, the dependent variables will be lower for disfluent text than fluent text when participants are shown the materials in the fluent then disfluent order.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3.4 Methods\n\nBriefly describe the study design (i.e., experimental or correlational?) and sample.\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the left middle of page 4, the study is a 2x2 mixed design. Note: the authors do not specifically outline the design in shorthand, but they describe each independent variable. The sample included 65 university students from the authors’ department.\n\n\n\n\nWhat were the variables? i.e., independent and dependent variables for experiments; variables for correlations.\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIV1 is between-subjects and includes the contrast group for which order they see the text. IV2 is within-subjects and includes both fluent and disfluent text conditions. The study has several dependent variables including ease of learning, prediction of performance, and actual memory performance.\n\n\n\n\nBriefly describe the study procedure in everyday terms.\n\nPages  and  best include this information. There is also a diagram to help explain the procedure on page .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each fluent and disfluent text, participants briefly saw the text and completed the dependent variables related to the first monitoring judgments. For example, rating how confident they were about their performance. Then the participants studied the text for up to 15 minutes and completed the second monitoring judgments. Depending on IV1, they either read the disfluent text first or the fluent text first. When they finished reading both texts, they completed knowledge tests for both texts at the end.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3.5 Results\n\nWhat were the important results? There are several pages of results to cover each dependent variable, so for the purposes of this exercise, focus on the performance results. Did participants recall more information about the fluent or disfluent text?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bottom left of page 7, performance is the last dependent variable they analyse before summarising all their results. There was a statistically significant main effect of fluency. This means if you ignore which contrast group they were allocated to, performance was higher for fluent text than disfluent text. Note: the authors also use something called Bayesian statistics which we do not cover in this course.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3.6 Inferences\n\nWhat did the authors conclude from their study?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the top and middle of page 7, the authors recap their results at the start of the discussion. When the fluent text was presented first, participants use fluency as a cue for all learning judgements (e.g., ease of learning and prediction of performance). Participants rated these variables as lower for the disfluent text than for the fluent text. However, when the disfluent text was presented first, participants no longer use fluency as a cue for learning judgments and there was no significant difference between fluent and disfluent texts.\n\n\n\n\nHow did the authors use the results to make inferences and conclusions about the hypothesis and research question?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the top and middle of page 7, the authors concluded their results support both hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 1 predicted there would be no difference in learning judgments when participants read the disfluent then the fluent text. Hypothesis 2 predicted learning judgments would be lower for the disfluent text when participants read the fluent then the disfluent text.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.4 Organising journal articles\nThe QALMRI method applies to individual journal articles, but in your assignments, we expect you to read several articles to build a literature review. You can take the QALMRI method and create a table using something like Word or Excel to collate the articles you read.

Journal articles are typically written for expert audiences, so they may not specifically label key information you are looking for. For example, in the exercise above, Pieger et al. did not say they used a 2x2 mixed design. You had to recognise the information in the main text and piece it together. As you read more journal articles, you will get quicker at recognising this information, allowing you to focus more time on reading the article critically than simply understanding it.\nIf you would like additional tips and resources on reading journal articles, you might find the following articles useful:\n\nThis short blog by Raff (2016) aims to explain journal articles to non-scientists, so it should provide an accessible introduction.\nThis short article by Pain (2016) has quotes from several high-profile researchers where they explain how they approach reading a scientific paper.\nThis long article by Carey et al. (2020) discusses how to approach reading a journal article for different purposes by presenting 10 rules to follow.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction to the general topic and research question.\nEvaluation of relevant research and theory.\nEstablish a rationale for the current study.\nPresent the research question and hypothesis (where applicable).\n\n\n\n\n11.1.1 Introduction to the general topic and research question\nThe opening paragraph or two to the introduction is the broadest section. We are at the top of the hourglass and this is where you introduce your reader to the key concepts. You are trying to provide the rationale behind your overall topic, so you might include statistics to highlight the extend of a given problem. You might also present definitions for key concepts to make it clear to your reader what you are researching. This part of the introduction is all about setting the scene to your reader and establishing why it is a topic worth addressing.\n\n11.1.2 Evaluation of relevant research and theory\nThe literature review should provide a critical and focused exploration of your topic area. You do not need to try and summarise all the research that has ever been done on your topic, you are trying to identify what is most relevant and up-to-date.\nCritical evaluation is an important skill that takes time to develop. Instead of just listing and describing the studies in your literature review, you must add narrative and identify gaps in current knowledge. Try and ask yourself as you are documenting the studies you find:\n\nAre the findings consistent across studies, or do they provide a more complicated mixed picture?\nAll studies are not created equally, each will have their own strength and weaknesses. You do not need to walk through the strengths and limitations of each study, but you will make an assessment on how reliable you consider the evidence base to be.\nIs there a relevant theory or framework that explains the observations of previous research? Do the studies support this theory or suggest there are limitations?\n\n11.1.3 Establish a rationale for the current study\nBy the end of the introduction, you are trying to clearly communicate what opportunity you have identified in past research and present your argument for why it is important to address that opportunity. This is the rationale as the reasoning behind why your study is necessary. Sometimes the opportunity is to explore something new, other times you could identify limitations in past research that need addressing. There is not one single valid approach to the rationale, it all depends on the strength of your argument you presented throughout the introduction.\nTo show the range of possibilities for the strategy behind your rationale, we wrote a specific section and activities on identifying the rationale below.\n\n11.1.4 Present the research question and hypothesis\nThe final part of your introduction should be a summary of what you want to find out in your study (your research question) and what you predict you will find based on previous research (your hypothesis). The most effective introductions will present a clear narrative from the start to the end, so the reader can almost guess what your rationale, research question, and hypothesis is before you tell them.\nDepending on the aim of your study, remember a research question is essential, but a hypothesis is not. If your study is exploratory, there might not be enough research to make a prediction, so the aim of your study is gather evidence. If you study is confirmatory, there will be a larger research base and the aim of your study is to test a specific prediction.\n\n11.1.4.1 Research questions\nResearch Questions (RQs) are broad overarching questions of interest. They are posed literally as questions and summarise what you hope to answer through your study. Research questions should be:\n\nClear: specific enough to be understood without further explanation.\nFocused: narrow enough that you can answer it with your project.\nComplex: there is enough discussion to create a report out of it.\nConcise: to the point so it is more likely to be understood.\nArguable: there is not already a clearly accepted answer and there is a rationale for your project, regardless of whether it is more of a novel approach or it is a direct replication of one specific study.\n\nIt is crucial to base your research question on previous research. Make sure you have read enough to pose your research question as you need to know what is already out there before you can present the rationale for your study.\nAn example of a poor research question could be: Do undergraduate students suffer from text anxiety? It is quite vague and the context is unclear for what is being compared and how. A better research question could be: Do undergraduate students self-report greater test anxiety than postgraduate students? This is more focused on the actual research at hand, showing who you are comparing and giving more detail on what you want to measure.\n\n11.1.4.2 Hypotheses\nHypotheses are specific statements making a prediction for what you will find. Hypotheses should be:\n\nClear: you can easily understand the statement.\nSpecific: you cover all the key information, such as who, what, and how.\nFalsifiable: you should be able test the prediction to show how evidence either supports or refutes it.\nOperationalised: to state how you are measuring your constructs.\n\nTo break down these features, we can start with a good example of: We hypothesise that there will be a positive correlation between effort regulation scores and help-seeking scores in mature students, as measured through the MSLQ. We can then manipulate different features for emphasis:\n\nMissing operationalisation: We hypothesise that there will be a positive correlation between effort regulation scores and help-seeking scores in mature students.\nNot testable: We hypothesise that there might be a positive correlation between effort regulation scores and help-seeking scores in mature students.\nNot a hypothesis: Is there a positive correlation between effort regulation and help-seeking?\n\nDepending on how much previous literature is out there and how convinced you are by it, you can pose a directional or non-directional hypothesis. A directional hypothesis makes a prediction in a specific direction, for instance group A will be faster than group B. On the other hand, a non-directional hypothesis predicts there will be an effect, but it is not clear what direction it will be. For example, the speed of group A will be different to the speed of group B.\nYou might pose a non-directional hypothesis for exploratory research to help your focus. For confirmatory research, you should be able to specify a clear directional prediction to test.\n\n11.1.4.3 How does this relate to your stage one group report?\nFor your stage one group report, you will be focusing on either the relationship between two variables or comparing the difference in one outcome between two groups. Depending on which approach you and your group are taking, the terminology you use for the research question and hypothesis will differ.\nCorrelations assess whether there is a relationship between two variables. You might have a non-directional prediction where you think two variables are correlated, but you are not sure how. Alternatively, you might have a directional prediction where you expect a certain correlation direction. Positive correlations are where if one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase. Negative correlations are where if one variable increases, the other variables tends to decrease. If some of the terminology is unfamiliar to you at this point, we do not cover correlations and continuous predictors until week 7 after reading week.\nIn contrast, comparing groups assesses whether there is a difference between two groups on your outcome. If you have a non-directional hypothesis, you think there might be a difference between the two groups, but you are not sure which direction. If you have a directional hypothesis, you expect one group to score higher than the other group. You will learn about t-tests and categorical predictors for the analysis techniques suited to this kind of research question in week 8.",

    "section": "\n11.2 Identifying the rationale",
    "text": "11.2 Identifying the rationale\nNow we have introduced the key components of an introduction, we want to spend a little more time on different strategies for the rationale. As much as we would love to just tinker as scientists, each study tries to address some kind of problem the authors have identified in previous research. These are often small tweaks. Keep the phrase “standing on the shoulders of giants” in mind as science typically advances through minor changes rather than completely revolutionary ways of studying a topic. Approaches for the rationale will differ by discipline and sub-discipline but there are some common strategies you can look out for.\nIn this section, we have provided seven examples of the rationale from different empirical psychology articles, including exploration, replications, testing competing theories, applying the methods from one study to a new sample/population or topic, and addressing limitations in past research. The rationale should be built as a thread running throughout the introduction as you narrow down to what your study focuses on, but we have isolated paragraphs that specifically comment on the opportunity they have identified. For each example, we have explained the general approach, provided an extract, and described in our own words the authors’ line of argument.\nAt the end, we have some activities to test if you can recognise different strategies. By the end of this resource, you will be able to identify different strategies behind the rationale in published research and hopefully clearly communicate the rationale in your own reports.\n\n11.2.1 Exploring an under researched topic\nAlthough completely novel research is rare, there are times when there is little knowledge about a population or topic. For example, there might be a change in practice or a cultural phenomenon that means you have little prior research to turn to. This means your study would follow more of an exploratory approach to gather information and learn about a new population or topic.\nExample: Beaudry et al. (2022, pg. 2) were interested in what incoming undergraduate students knew about open science practices. Moving out of the replication crisis, increasing numbers of researchers adopted open science practices and more journals were encouraging or enforcing them. As this was a rapid shift in how researchers conducted studies, Beaudry et al. explored undergraduate students’ beliefs about open science practices as they had little prior research for this cultural shift.\n\n“…An understanding of contemporary methodological practices—and problematic methodological practices—is essential for becoming informed and critical consumers of psychological knowledge. Studies have explored strategies for educating psychology students about replicability and open science practices (e.g., Chopik et al., 2018; Grahe et al., 2012; Jekel et al., 2020). These initiatives may help ingrain open science norms and change attitudes about research practices, but we know little about what students know or believe about open science research practices prior to entering the university classroom. This knowledge could be useful for two main reasons… [two paragraph gap]\n\n\nTo examine this, we conducted a descriptive study, asking incoming students in undergraduate psychology courses about their beliefs regarding reproducibility and open science practices. Our survey encompassed questions concerning norms (how students felt research should be conducted), norms in practice (how students believe psychological research is conducted), and replicability (how replicable students believe psychological research is). Our study was exploratory (see Wagenmakers et al., 2012) and descriptive; as such, we did not specify or test hypotheses.”\n\n\n11.2.2 Direct replication of a previous study\nAuthors can argue it is important to verify the results of a specific previous study. This means they would use the exact same method as the target study but in a new sample to find out if you can get the same results. The rationale for a direct replication often explains why it is important to replicate individual studies in general or why the target study should be replicated. For different features of a study you might highlight to motivate a direct replication, Alister et al. (2021) polled researchers on features that would increase or decrease their confidence in replicating the study’s results.\nExample: Micallef and Newton (2022, pg. 2) investigate the use of concrete examples in learning abstract concepts. Their article is a direct replication of a specific study they highlight. They explain Rawson et al. is an influential study but other research questions the consistency of the findings, so they want to replicate their method as closely as possible to see if they get the same results.\n\n“Thus, the evidence base for the use of concrete examples in teaching would appear to be mixed. Given the potential significance of Rawson et al. for the teaching of psychology, but set against some mixed findings from other studies, we tested the replicability of the key finding from Rawson et al. Rawson gave their participants definitions of some abstract ideas from psychology, followed by multiple different concrete examples of those ideas. A control group received only the definitions, repeatedly. Both groups were then tested to determine whether they could match examples to definitions. The group which had received the concrete examples were better able to match definitions to examples including, critically, examples that they had not previously seen. Rawson et al. suggested their study was amongst the first study of its kind to use a ‘no-example’ control group, a design which considerably strengthened the conclusions but highlighted the paucity of well-controlled research into the application of this idea to learning and teaching, and further emphasised the need for replication of the findings from this key study.”\n\n\n11.2.3 Conceptual replication of a previous study\nWhereas a direct replication wants to copy the method of a study as closely as possible, a conceptual replication tries to test the same idea or hypothesis using different methods (Nosek & Errington, 2017). The aim is to find out if you can make similar conclusions under different methods and increase your confidence in an explanation or theory of human behaviour.\nKeep in mind there is a continuum between a direct and conceptual replication. It comes down to judgement and subject expertise on what differences would turn a direct replication into a conceptual replication. For instance, Lebel et al. (2018) present a replication recipe where authors rate their methods as exact, close, or different on features including measures, procedure, and location.\nExample: Ekuni et al. (2020, pg. 5) wanted to learn about study strategies in a different population. They highlighted previous studies focused on US American samples which tend to be relatively higher in education level and socioeconomic status than some other countries. Therefore, they took the method of Karpicke et al. (2009) - a US-based study - and applied it to a sample in Brazil to investigate if they could find a similar pattern of results.\n\n“This is even more important in countries in which educational outcomes are poorer than those in the U.S. and in which the need for interventions that can help improve academic success and reduce educational inequities is dire (see UNESCO, 2015; Master, Meltzoff, & Lent, 2016), such as Brazil. To do so, it is necessary to carry out a conceptual replication on preference of study techniques in more diverse non-WEIRD contexts to analyze whether culture of origin, SES, and sex can influence students’ study strategies, because designing adequate interventions may have to consider tailoring to fit particular characteristics of different types of students.”\n\n\n11.2.4 Testing competing theories or conflicting research\nAs you research a given area, you recognise patterns across the findings of articles. Imagine you are studying the effectiveness of an intervention treatment compared to a control treatment. Do all the studies show the intervention works, do most studies show the intervention works, or is there completely mixed evidence on whether the intervention performs better than the control? If there are conflicting findings, then the aim of your study could be to add more evidence.\nRelatedly, there might be competing theories on the same phenomenon. One theory might expect participants to score higher in one condition compared to another, while another theory expects participants to score higher in the other condition. This means the aim of your study could be to find out which theory is best supported.\nExample: Bartlett et al. (2022, pg. 2) combined both components after observing some studies showed daily smokers’ attention would gravitate towards smoking images more than non-daily smokers, whereas other studies showed the opposite pattern. There were theories which could support each observation, so Bartlett et al. aimed to test which theory and pattern of results would receive the most support.\n\n“…Collectively, these studies show that smokers consistently display greater attentional bias towards smoking cues than non-smokers, but it is not clear whether lighter or heavier smokers show greater attentional bias.\n\n\nTo address this inconsistency, the current study focused on comparing attentional bias towards smoking cues in daily and non-daily smokers. While most studies use the visual probe task to measure attentional bias, their relatively small sample sizes and inconsistent research design features complicate drawing conclusions from the mixed findings. Therefore, we used a much larger sample size than previous studies and manipulated different features of the visual probe task.”\n\n\n11.2.5 Applying the methods of one study to a new sample/population\nIt is important to consider whether your planned measures and/or manipulations are valid and reliable. This means you could identify components of the method you consider robust in previous research, but you apply them to a new sample or population that would let you address your research question.\nThis is similar to the argument in the conceptual replication example, but there is a subtle difference in the aims of the approach. In a conceptual replication, you want to know whether you can find similar results using different methods. The emphasis is on comparing your findings to a target study to see if they are similar or different. On the other hand, in this approach, you want to learn something new by applying methods from one study to a new sample. The emphasis is on addressing a new research question using methods that have a precedent in past research.\nExample: Veldkamp et al. (2017, pg. 128/129) investigated the storybook image of scientists in scientists themselves. In their introduction, they outlined studies on the general public’s perception of scientists’ characteristics like honesty and objectivity. However, the authors explained they were unaware of similar research of scientists’ perception of scientists’ characteristics. This means they were applying methods to a new sample that was previously under researched.\n\n“…More recently, European and American surveys have demonstrated that lay people have a stable and strong confidence both in science (Gauchat 2012; Smith and Son 2013) and in scientists (Ipsos MORI 2014; Smith and Son 2013). For example, the scientific community was found to be the second most trusted institution in the United States (Smith and Son 2013), and in the United Kingdom, the general public believed that scientists meet the expectations of honesty, ethical behavior, and open-mindedness (Ipsos MORI 2014).\n\n\nAs far as we know, no empirical work has addressed scientists’ views of the scientist. Although preliminary results from Robert Pennock’s “Scientific Virtues Project” (cited in “Character traits: Scientific virtue,” 2016) indicate that scientists consider honesty, curiosity, perseverance, and objectivity to be the most important virtues of a scientist, these results do not reveal whether scientists believe that the typical scientist actually exhibits these virtues…”\n\n\n11.2.6 Applying the methods of one study to a new topic\nRelated to the previous strategy, you might not have a new sample/population you want to learn about, but you might want to apply the methods of a past study to a new topic. For instance, your research question might focus on alcohol but previous studies you are aware of might have used smoking images. The emphasis in this strategy is that you want to learn something new by applying the methods of one study to a different topic.\nExample: Irving et al. (2022, pg. 2) studied the effect of correcting statistical misinformation. Making causal claims about correlations is a common mistake in science journalism when you lose some of the nuance of full journal articles and the authors wanted to know if you could correct that statistical misinformation. Previous studies had corrected other types of misinformation using this technique, but Irving et al. wanted to know whether it would be effective in reducing statistical misinformation. This means they applied the method from one study to a new topic it had not been used on before.\n\n“In this study, we applied the continued influence paradigm, which has traditionally been used to examine general misinformation, to a novel context. We investigated whether it is possible to correct a common form of statistical misinformation present in popular media: inappropriately drawing causal conclusions from correlational evidence. Participants were randomized to one of two experimental conditions: no-correction or correction. They read a fictional news story about the relationship between extended TV watching and cognitive decline, inspired by an article in The New York Times (Bakalar, 2019). Informed by previous research, we designed the correction to be as powerful as possible. We therefore included an alternative explanation, in recognition of the fact that individuals prefer to maintain a complete but incorrect model of an event until they are given an alternative explanation to sufficiently fill the gap left by a simple negation (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). Similarly, we ensured that the correction was from a credible source, that it maintained coherence with the story, and explained why the misinformation was inaccurate (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). The primary, confirmatory hypotheses were that participants in the correction condition would make fewer causal inferences (i.e., rely on the misinformation) and more correlational inferences (i.e., rely on the correction) than those in the no-correction condition, in response to the coded inference questions.”\n\n\n11.2.7 Addressing limitations in the method of a previous study\nEvery study has its strengths and weaknesses, the important thing is being able to justify your choices and acknowledge the limitations. One set of researchers might value a tightly controlled environment at the expense of a more realistic but messier environment, whereas you value a more realistic environment. In this strategy, your research question aims to learn something new by designing a study that addresses the limitations you identify in a past study.\nExample: Bostyn et al. (2018, page 2) were interested in the classic trolley dilemma where participants have the option of letting a tram run over five people or intervene and divert the tram so it runs over one person. Often, this is only a hypothetical dilemma, so the authors wanted to create a more realistic version. Instead of choosing to divert a tram, participants were faced with the option of shocking a cage of five mice or intervening and shocking a cage containing one mouse (the participants were unaware the mice would not actually be shocked). This means the authors wanted to investigate if participants would behave similarly in a more ecological valid task.\n\n“Until recently, this judgment–behavior discrepancy has been an academic concern plaguing only moral psychologists. However, trolley-dilemma-like situations are becoming increasingly relevant to model the moral decisions of artificial intelligence, such as self-driving autonomous vehicles (Bonnefon, Shariff, & Rahwan, 2016). Accordingly, whether or not hypothetical moral judgment is related to real-life behavior is prone to become a matter of public interest. We are aware of one study that has directly compared hypothetical moral judgment with real-life behavior: FeldmanHall et al. (2012) found that people are more willing to harm others for monetary profit in a real-life scenario than they are in a hypothetical version of the same scenario, thus confirming that real-life behavior can differ dramatically from hypothetical judgment. The current research was a first attempt to study this difference in the trolley-dilemma context through the admission of a”real-life” dilemma that required participants to make a trolley-dilemma-like decision between either allowing a very painful electroshock to be administered to five mice or choosing to deliver the entire shock to a single mouse.”\n\n\n11.2.8 Summary\nSo far, we have outlined the strategies behind the rationale from a selection of empirical psychology articles. This is not an exhaustive list, but we wanted to demonstrate the common lines of argument researchers take when explaining what opportunity they identified in past research and how their studies will address that opportunity.\nIt will be rare for studies to neatly fit into just one strategy. They might focus on one component or it might be a combination. Bostyn et al. (2018) addressed limitations in past research but you could also argue it was a conceptual replication by using a more ecologically valid task to see if they could observe similar findings to studies using hypothetical tasks. Likewise, Bartlett et al. (2022) tested competing theories, but also wanted to address limitations in the method of past studies.\nThe important lesson to take away from this is to clearly communicate your line of argument behind the rationale of your study. By the end of your introduction, it should be clear what opportunity you identified in previous research and why it is important for you to address that opportunity with your study.\n\n11.2.9 Activities\nNow that you have read about different strategies for a rationale and explored different examples, it is time to see if you can recognise key features of these strategies yourself. Remember, these are broad descriptions to capture the main features and there are many ways of presenting your argument for the rationale.\n\n11.2.9.1 Independent judgement 1: Muir et al. (2020)\nIn the following extract, Muir et al. (2020) explain their study on promoting classroom engagement through the use of an online student response system.\nAs you read through the extract, consider and select which strategy you think best fits their rationale. After selecting the type of rationale you think best fits, check the explain the answer box to see why we placed it there.\n\n“The use of Socrative has been investigated across a variety of disciplines including physics (Coca and Slisko 2013), physiology (Rae and O’Malley 2017), science (Wash 2014), sports management (Dervan 2014), computing (Awedh et al. 2014), English language (Kaya and Balta 2016), economics (Piatek 2014), and engineering (Dabbour 2016). Statistics courses are another area that may benefit from using Socrative given its potential positive effect on the student learning experience and considering that course evaluations by students taking statistics units tend to indicate poor engagement (Gladys, Nicholas, and Crispen 2012). To the authors’ knowledge, only one study has previously investigated the effect of Socrative specifically for statistics students. Balta and Guvercin (2016) found that the final grades of students enrolled in a statistics class who chose to engage with Socrative-based learning materials prior to their exam were significantly higher than the grades achieved by students who chose not to engage with the Socrative-based learning materials. Although this result is encouraging, the use of a non-randomized, post-test design means that we cannot confirm from this study that there is a beneficial effect for using Socrative, or if the difference in exam scores was due to underlying scholastic aptitude or motivation of the students who chose to engage with the OSRS. Hence, there is a need for further research exploring the use of Socrative specifically within statistics classrooms”\n\n\nWhat is the most fitting type of rationale?\n\nExploring an under researched topic.Direct replication of a previous study.Conceptual replication of a previous study.Addressing limitations in the method of a previous study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, the authors highlight there is one key article that studied a previous topic but they identified several flaws in the method that affect the conclusions. The earlier study by Balta and Guvercin (2016) uses a non-randomised post-test design which is prone to confounds and you cannot make a strong causal conclusion. In the next paragraph not shown here, the authors explain their study will target these limitations by randomising participants into conditions.\n\n\n\n\n11.2.9.2 Independent judgement 2: Harms et al. (2018)\nIn the following extract, Harms et al. (2018, pg. 2) explain their study on the rounded price effect.\nAs you read through the extract, consider and select which strategy you think best fits their rationale. After selecting the type of rationale you think best fits, check the explain the answer box to see why we placed it there.\n\n“In recent years, studies from nearly all subfields of psychology have been under increased scrutiny in the context of the ‘replication crisis’ [2-5]: as several studies suggest, we cannot take reported effects in the scientific literature at face value. As the findings by Wadhwa and Zhang have practical relevance to marketers, independent replication of the effect and a reasonable estimation of its size are desirable. From the theoretical outline of the effect one can expect the effect to be contingent on various factors. As a first step towards a better understanding of these external influences on the effect, a close replication under the same or at least very similar conditions as in the original study is warranted.”\n\n\nWhat is the most fitting type of rationale?\n\nExploring an under researched topic.Direct replication of a previous study.Conceptual replication of a previous study.Addressing limitations in the method of a previous study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, this was quite an obvious one. The authors mention a few times they want to replicate the rounded price effect that was first observed in Wadhwa and Zhang. They justify the direct replication by explaining it has practical implications to marketers and want to repeat the study as close as possible to the original methods.\n\n\n\n\n11.2.9.3 Independent judgement 3: Rode and Ringel (2019)\nIn the following extract, Rode and Ringel (2019, pg. 320) explain their study on comparing the use of R and SPSS software in introductory statistics courses.\nAs you read through the abstract, consider and select which strategy you think best fits their rationale. After selecting the type of rationale you think best fits, check the explain the answer box to see why we placed it there.\n\n“Professors of courses without lab components, and/or courses in which students have high levels of statistics anxiety and diverse mathematical and computational backgrounds, may be left wondering whether it is worthwhile to introduce students to R over other software types. Indeed, ongoing debates in online education communities suggest that the use of R with undergraduates, and how the experience compares to teaching software such as SPSS, is very much an open question that many educators would like to see answered empirically (e.g., see https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_it_easier_for_students_to_learn_statistics_using_SPSS_or_R). Statistics professors have likewise written blogs about the benefits and drawbacks of R and SPSS (e.g., Anglim, 2013; Franklin, 2018; Wall, 2014). These debates capture the concern that R is a highly useful program for students but comes with a steeper learning curve and fewer resources available for beginners compared to other software, leading instructors to question whether it is wise to emphasize R in an introductory course (especially those for non-statistics majors). To the best of our knowledge, no study has explicitly compared the teaching of R to statistical software more commonly used with undergraduates, such as SPSS. Moreover, there is little research on incorporating statistical output in the introductory classroom, much less whether one type of output is more advantageous than another.”\n\n\nWhat is the most fitting type of rationale?\n\nExploring an under researched topic.Direct replication of a previous study.Conceptual replication of a previous study.Addressing limitations in the method of a previous study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key details are in the final two sentences to explain they are not aware of past research comparing the software and they want to explore this under researched topic. Previously, Rode and Ringel discussed statistics anxiety and the use of different software to teach introductory statistics courses. However, they were not aware of previous studies that compared software and investigated whether one was better than the other.\n\n\n\n\n11.2.10 How does this apply to my stage one group report?\nNow you have read different strategies and worked through activities to identify potential arguments for the rationale, you can think in your group what your line of argument will be. As you conduct your literature review for the introduction, you will start to develop a sense of what research is out there on your topic and what research is missing.\nFor example, there might be research on test anxiety and self-efficacy in isolation, but maybe there are seemingly no studies looking at the direct relationship between them. You might find lots of research looking at the relationship between intrinsic motivation and age in undergraduate students, but maybe there are no studies on postgraduates. There is one key study comparing meta-cognitive self-regulation in undergraduates and postgraduates, but it has not been independently directly replicated.\nThe strategies for the rationale above was not an exhaustive list, so do not worry if your rationale does not neatly fit into one of these categories. There is not one correct approach as it will depend on how you present the literature review and work towards the gap you identified in past research. By the end of the introduction, it is just important to clearly communicate and justify your rationale to the reader so they can see your line of argument.",

However, if you are not testing any groups then you might not need this and you just need the overall view.\nHowever, it is not necessary to go into lots of detail about something like nationality or other demographics if you do not think it is relevant to the outcome of your study.\n\n\n\nAny inclusion or exclusion criteria\n\nInclusion criteria are features you are looking for in your sample.\nExclusion criteria are features that you would exclude people from your sample.\nThese are not necessarily opposites, think of it as inclusion criteria are what would get people into your sample, and exclusion criteria are what would remove people from your sample once you recruited them.\n\n\n\nThink about the order that you present information within a section.\n\nRemember you are leading a reader through the methods, so it is important for them to be able to follow what you are saying. This means thinking about what they will know at certain points and what they will understand. Ask yourself, “will this make sense to a reader if I present this information now, or should I present it later/earlier?”\nFor example, if you plan on excluding people and this changes the possible demographics of your groups, then it would make sense to present the demographics after you have presented the exclusion criteria, so it is clear the demographics are of those left in your study and do not include people you removed.",

Assume the reader knows nothing about the questionnaires and software here and you are trying to explain the materials to them so they can understand what they are and how you used them.\nA well-written materials section should allow someone who was not part of the research team to replicate the study. You are trying to give them as much detail as possible that they could run your study, but sometimes longer details (such as a full list of questions) can be included in the appendix to save space in the main report.\nYou would normally include aspects such as:\n\n\nDemographic questions\n\nHow many questions were there?\nWhat were the response options?\nGive an example of a question or two. It does not have to detail every question but you can summarise the main points.\nFor example: “We asked {state number} demographic questionnaires to establish age, nationality… with dropdown category options to respond to … and free-response boxes to answer..”\nAgain, think about what is relevant. Focus on detailing the demographics you are using for the analysis. If you are not using a demographic variable, then keep this just as a broad overview of the types of question you ask participants.\n\n\n\nMotivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ)\n\nYou should describe the full MSLQ and state which subscale/s you will use data from.\nYou do not have to list all the subscales but give an overview of the general purpose of the questionnaire and then focus on the subscale(s) you are using and what construct they measure.\nThe MSLQ should have an APA citation (available in the MSLQ overview document).\nExplain details like how many questions there were in total and how many questions are in your relevant subscale/s.\nWhat were the response options for the subscale/s?\nFor example: “The help-seeking subscale is made up of 5 questions such as”example question” and “example question”, with potential responses on a 5-point Likert scale where 1 means .. and 5 means..”\n\n\n\nYou should also cite the software you (from your perspective as the researcher) used to host the questionnaire.\n\nFor example: “We collected data using the platform Experimentum (DeBruine et al., 2020)…”\nDeBruine, L., Lai, R., Jones, B., Abdullah, R., & Mahrholz, G.

    "text": "12.3 Procedure\nThe procedure details what happened in the study. This section normally comes after the materials section as the reader needs to understand what you used before they can understand how you used them. It can take a while to recognise the distinction between the two sections as you are trying to avoid overlap wherever possible between the sections. Consider the materials as what participants completed and the procedure as when in the study they completed each component of the materials.\nThe main point to keep in mind when writing this section is to think about reproducibility. After reading this sub-section, a reader should be able to reproduce your study exactly, based on what you have written in the materials and procedure.\nFor studies like this, you often only need one paragraph to explain the procedure, but it does not necessarily need to be if it makes more sense to break things up. However, try and avoid your writing becoming too granular by using one sentence paragraphs or bullet points.\nYou would normally include aspects such as:\n\nWhat the participants did in the study, what order they did things in, how the study looked to them, and roughly how long it took them to complete.\nTry to think about how the participant accessed the study. Remember you can watch the screencast on Moodle to remind yourself of any details of how participants worked through the study.\nThe procedure is typically where you outline the ethics processes, such as reading the information sheet and providing consent at the start, and reading the debrief at the end. You do not need to explain what information these documents contain, just when they read them and how the participants interacted with them.\nYou can include the colour of font and background colour.\nYou explain the order participants completed the materials: did they do the demographics and then the MSLQ, or vice versa? Did all participants complete the materials in the same order or was there any randomisation?\nWere all the questions on one screen or did participants see one question at a time?\nHow did participants respond: did they use the mouse, did they use certain keys, did they speak their answer?\nDid participants have a time limit to respond by or could they take as long as they want? What could participants do if they did not want to respond to a question?\n\nIf you find you are repeating a lot of information from the materials, then there is a good chance you are mixing up what information goes where. Remember: the procedure is about what participants saw and did, and how the study was presented to them. The main goal here is to find a balance between providing enough detail for someone to replicate your study without taking up too much of the word count better spent elsewhere.\nFor example, you could reduce: “Participants saw an advert on social media and then they clicked on the link and then they read the consent form and then if they decided they wanted to do the study they consented and then they started answering the questions”\nTo be more concise: “Participants accessed the study through a link on social media. Before starting the study, participants read an information sheet and gave consent to taking part.”",

You are testing the mean score on a subscale of the MSLQ, it is not just something like self-efficacy as an abstract concept.\n\n\n\nWhere applicable, state the independent variable and it’s levels (conditions or groups depending on your design)\n\nYou can clarify it is a quasi-experimental variable in this study since they were only self-selecting groups.\n\n\n\nYou could report a power analysis here to outline how many participants you estimates you need to detect your smallest effect size of interest.

Alternatively, you could report it at the start of your results section.

These concepts will be unfamiliar to you in week 4, but you will learn about them in week 5 and beyond.\n\n\n\nBriefly state how you planned on analysing the data\n\nYou would state the type of test/model, use of R (with citations), and any relevant packages.\nThe idea here is to constrain those researcher degrees of freedom, so you are outlining how you plan on analysing the data to the best of your knowledge, so you can explain and justify any deviations from this plan in your stage two individual report.",

Try to follow the guidance above on what goes where.\nYou must use sub-headings and we would highly recommend the sub-headings we have stated here.\nTry to avoid repeating information across sections. If you find you are doing that, then it is likely that you are including information in the wrong sections. Each section has a different focus and it will be an important part of the editing process to identify and cut this out.\nIt’s difficult to balance being concise but detailed enough that someone could replicate your work. It will take work in the editing process to consider what is essential and what you can cut, but try not to waste words in the method section on redundant details. Save words for building your narrative in the introduction and discussion sections.\nReading journal articles and focusing on the method section is a good way to see what information can go where. There is a lot of variation in published articles though and they are not often perfect examples, so another thing to think about when reading papers is “what is missing here that would allow me to replicate this study?”",

    "text": "12.6 Manipulating examples of materials and procedure sections\nTo finish, we are going to manipulate elements of a materials and procedure section to help drive home some of the key points. Try to think about the questions and advice here when you look at your own materials and procedure sections, and see how you can generalise these key points to your participants and design and data analysis sections.\n\n12.6.1 Example 1: A procedure sub-section\nThis is the procedure section from Tsantani et al. (2016) which one of the team worked on. Although it’s published, it does not mean it is a perfect example. You are always learning and you might look back at something you wrote and wonder why you did it like that in the first place. Read the paragraph, then look at the highlighted sections after.\n\n“The experiment took place in the experimental laboratories of the University of Glasgow. Participants were required to complete a 2AFC task during which they listened to pairs of voices comprising high- and low-pitched versions of the original recordings. The sound samples were presented through headphones (participants’ own) connected to a computer with the sound set at approximately 80 dB Sound Pressure Level (SPL): System volume was measured prior to the experiment using a standard headphone set (Sennheisser Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO 250 OHM) and sound meter. At the beginning of the experiment, participants were informed, via on-screen instructions, that they would hear pairs of voices in two blocks, by trait, and would be asked to make a decision regarding each pair. Participants were told that there was no time limit to their decision but were encouraged to answer with their first impression. After each pair of voices the question”Which voice did you perceive as more {dominant} {trustworthy}?” was displayed on the screen. Pressing the “s” key would mean that they perceived Voice 1 as being most dominant or trustworthy, whereas the “k” key represented Voice 2. The definitions of dominance and trustworthiness used in the instructions were “Dominance means having power and influence over others” and “Trustworthiness means able to be relied on as honest or truthful.” The order of the dominance and trustworthiness blocks, as well as the order in which the voice trials were presented within the block, were counterbalanced across participants. Male and female trials were presented randomly within the same block, as opposed to being presented in different blocks, to avoid an additional potential block-order effect caused by the gender of the voice. Finally, the order of the high- and low-pitched versions of the recordings within each trial was counterbalanced by including two trials of each pair in a block, with the high- and low-pitched versions in a different order. Therefore, within each block, the 20 pairs of voice samples were presented twice. The voices within each pair were played consecutively with a 1-s pause between the first voice and the second voice, and participants proceeded to the next trial by pressing “space.” The experiment lasted approximately 14 min.”\n\n\n12.6.1.1 Highlighted section 1\n\n“After each pair of voices the question”Which voice did you perceive as more {dominant} {trustworthy}?” was displayed on the screen. Pressing the “s” key would mean that they perceived Voice 1 as being most dominant or trustworthy, whereas the “k” key represented Voice 2.”\n\n\nThis is clear on which keys participants had to use. This is quite specific detail, but clearly the authors had a reason for this. Normally, this will be because it helps reduce reaction times if you use specific keys and participants hold their fingers on those keys at all times.\nHowever, it does not say whether they told participants to always have their fingers on those keys and whether participants could see this “key-mapping” (what key represents what answer) all the time, just at the start, or just at breaks.\n\n12.6.1.2 Highlighted section 2\n\n“The definitions of dominance and trustworthiness used in the instructions were”Dominance means having power and influence over others” and “Trustworthiness means able to be relied on as honest or truthful.”\n\n\nThis is really clear on what the specific definitions were that participants were instructed to use but they do not state if these definitions were displayed throughout or just at the start. Would this make a difference if you tried to replicate the study? It might help to add one or two words to make it clear what actually happened.\n\n12.6.1.3 Highlighted section 3\n\n“The order of the dominance and trustworthiness blocks, as well as the order in which the voice trials were presented within the block, were counterbalanced across participants.”\n\n\nWords like “counterbalanced” are technical terms to help clarify what happened but reduce the word count of a longer explanation. However, it is a bit unclear what it means in terms of “voice trials”, so that might need further clarification.\n\n12.6.1.4 Highlighted section 4\n\n“Finally, the order of the high- and low-pitched versions of the recordings within each trial was counterbalanced by including two trials of each pair in a block, with the high- and low-pitched versions in a different order. Therefore, within each block, the 20 pairs of voice samples were presented twice. The voices within each pair were played consecutively with a 1-s pause between the first voice and the second voice, and participants proceeded to the next trial by pressing”space.”\n\n\nThis is getting rather complex and you could improve the explanation with an example (A vs B, B vs A) and the total number of trials (40). The main thing though is that it is trying to give enough detail for someone to replicate (1 second gap, press space etc.).\n\n12.6.1.5 Highlighted section 5\n\n“The experiment lasted approximately 14 min.”\n\n\nIt is always good to include the approximate time for participants to complete the study. If someone is replicating your study and their version takes 45 minutes, they know something is wrong.\n\n12.6.2 Example 2: A materials sub-section\nThis is adapted from the materials section of a first draft of a paper by Stuart McLaren and Phil McAleer in the department.\n\n“The Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS; Cruise et al., 1985) consists of 51 items comprised of two sections and six subscales. The first section includes 23 statements rated on a 5-point Likert scale that range from”1 = No Anxiety” to “5 = Strong Anxiety”. This section addresses three factors related to how individuals experience specific statistical situations: (a) Test and Class Anxiety (8-items with scores that range from 8 to 40), (b) Interpretation Anxiety (11-items with scores that range from 11 to 55) and (c) Fear of Asking for Help (4-items with scores that range from 4 to 20). For instance, statements include “Doing an examination for a statistics course” or “Going to ask my statistics teacher for individual help with material I am having difficulty in understanding”. The second section consists of 28 statements rated on a 5-point Likert scale that range from “1 = Strongly Disagree” to “5 = Strongly Agree”. This section examines levels of attitudes towards scenarios that involve statistics and statistics teachers over three factors: (d) Worth of Statistics (16-items with scores that range from 16 to 80), (e) Fear of Statistic Teachers (5-items with scores that range from 5 to 25), and (f) Computational Self-Concept (7-items with scores that range from 7 to 35). For example, statements include “I wish the statistics requirement would be removed from my academic program” or “Statisticians are more number orientated than they are people orientated”. A compound score of each subscale is calculated by summing item scores in each subscale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of statistics anxiety. The six subscales show good Cronbach’s alpha reliabilities between .81 and .94 (Chew et al., 2018).”\n\n\n12.6.2.1 Highlighted section 1\n\n“The Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS; Cruise et al., 1985) consists of 51 items comprised of two sections and six subscales.”\n\n\nAlthough we may have stated this information earlier in the introduction, we are now in the method section and all that relevant information needs to be here.\n\n12.6.2.2 Highlighted Section 2\n\n“The first section includes 23 statements rated on a 5-point Likert scale that range from”1 = No Anxiety” to “5 = Strong Anxiety”.\n\n\nNote here that we are talking about the scales for how it looked but not how the participants responded. Think about what information goes where at all times. In addition, would it help if we stated whether or not the values 2, 3, and 4 had labels on them or not? It would at least help if we said they had no labels.\n\n12.6.2.3 Highlighted Section 3\n\n“A compound score of each subscale is calculated by summing item scores in each subscale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of statistics anxiety.”\n\n\nThis works here, but it could also appear in the data analysis subsection. The idea is that by the time you get to the results, you know what is happening with the scales and how they are calculated and interpreted. A key observation here is that there is not one perfect approach but often when you start to think about the logical flow of information, the better approach sticks out.\n\n12.6.2.4 Highlighted Section 4\n\n“The six subscales show Cronbach’s alpha reliabilities between .81 and .94 (Chew et al., 2018).”\n\n\nFinally, we have not explored reliability of scales in much detail (briefly in lecture 2) but if you had that information from a previous paper, then it can be useful and helps give context to the scales to show they are valid and reliable. For one improvement, you could explain what the values mean for whether they suggest high or low reliability.",

    "section": "\n14.2 Statistical power recap",
    "text": "14.2 Statistical power recap\nIn null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we can put a limit on two types of error. Type I errors (false positives) are when we reject the null hypothesis and conclude a test was statistically significant, when really the null hypothesis is true. Type II errors (false negatives) are when we retain the null hypothesis and conclude a test was non-significant, when really the null hypothesis is false.\nStatistical power is related to the second type of error (type II). The definition of power is the long run probability of your study design correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when there is a true effect to be found. In short, “if an effect exists, how likely am I to detect it”? If a study has high statistical power, you would reliably detect a given effect size. If a study has low statistical power, you would not reliably detect a given effect size.\nIn null hypothesis significance testing, there are four key concepts:\n\nAlpha: The predetermined cut-off in your design at which you reject the null hypothesis (normally set at \\(\\alpha\\) = .05). This is your false positive error rate to limit the number of type I errors you would be willing to make.\nPower: The ability of a design to find an effect based on 1 - \\(\\beta\\), where beta is normally set at .20 or .10, producing power = .80 or .90. Beta is the false negative error rate to limit the number of type II errors you would be willing to make.\nEffect size: A number that expresses the magnitude of the phenomenon related to your research question. This will typically be Cohen’s d for the standardised mean difference in t-tests or the correlation coefficient r.\nSample size: The number of participants or observations in your study.\n\nConveniently, there is an interaction between the four key concepts of Alpha, Power, Effect Size, and Sample Size (APES). If you state three, you can calculate the fourth. Assuming you use the field standards of \\(\\alpha\\) = .05 and power = .80, choosing the final input of sample size or effect size produces one of two informative types of power analysis:\n\nA priori power analysis: You solve power analysis for the number of participants you need for a given value of \\(\\alpha\\), power, and effect size.\nSensitivity power analysis: You solve power analysis for the effect size you can detect for a given value of \\(\\alpha\\), power, and sample size.\n\nFor an example, Mehr et al. (2016, pg. 487) report the following a priori power analysis in their study on the effect of melody on infants:\n\n“Statistical power. The target sample size of 32 was determined before the experiment began, to ensure adequate power to detect a positive selective-attention effect. A similar experiment testing effects of language rather than music (Kinzler et al., 2007) obtained an effect size (d) of 0.54, and a sample of 32 had .84 power to detect an effect of this magnitude.”\n\nWe can reproduce their power analysis using the pwr package for a paired samples t-test (if you have not got to Chapter 10 in data skills yet, do not worry if this looks unfamiliar):\n\npwr.t.test(d = 0.54,\n           sig.level = .05,\n           power = .84,\n           type = \"paired\",\n           alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n     Paired t test power calculation \n\n              n = 31.91057\n              d = 0.54\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.84\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number of *pairs*\n\n\nSince we left the argument n blank, we receive that as the output of our a priori power analysis. We need 31.91 participants, but we always round up to a whole number of participants to avoid underestimating, so we would need 32 participants. The power analysis in Mehr et al. provides one example, but it is not perfect. There are some inputs they do not explicitly specify, so we will return to this example in reporting your power analysis below.\nFor your stage one report (and looking forward to your dissertation), you could report an a priori power analysis to inform how many participants you would need to detect your smallest effect size of interest. Power analysis and pre-registration is most informative in the design phase of research, so you would typically perform a power analysis to inform how many participants you try and recruit.\nJust keep in mind: for the assignment in RM1 you have no control over the final sample size as we collected data for you. This means there might be a difference in your planned sample size from the a priori power analysis and the final sample size you work with. Therefore, we have a section on sensitivity power analysis to consider potential differences in your planned vs final sample size.",

    "text": "14.3 Choosing a smallest effect size of interest\nFor an a priori power analysis, you need to enter an effect size. The term we use for this is the smallest effect size of interest. It is rare you would know precisely what effect size you were looking for - as you would not need the study if you understood the topic that well. This means your smallest effect size of interest represents the threshold for what effect sizes you want your study sensitive enough to detect. Power exists along a curve, so holding the sample size and all other inputs constant, you would be less likely to detect smaller effects, but more likely to detect effects larger than your smallest effect of interest.\nThe following plot is a power curve showing the relationship between the correlation coefficient r as the effect size and statistical power for a given sample size. Assuming our power analysis suggested we need to collect 60 participants, we would have 80% power to detect effects of r = .36. The smallest effect size of interest is where the two lines meet for your desired level of power (here 80%). As you move down the curve highlighted by the grey region, you would be less likely to detect effects smaller than your smallest effect size of interest. As you move up the curve, you would be more likely to detect effects larger than your smallest effect size of interest. In short, and assuming you want to keep power at 80% or higher, then you would be looking for effect sizes at, or greater than, your smallest effect size of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate what this looks like for a larger smallest effect size of interest, if your power analysis suggested we need 30 participants, we would have 80% power to detect effects of r = .49. The smallest effect size of interest is again represented by where the two lines meet. Since we only wanted our design to be sensitive to larger effects, there is a larger grey region to highlight the effects we would be less likely to detect. As you move down the curve, you would be less likely to detect effects smaller than r = .49. As you move up the curve, you would be more likely to detect effects larger than r = .49. In short, you would be still be looking for effect sizes at, or greater than, your smallest effect size of interest, but that threshold shifts to exclude a larger region of smaller effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming you use the field standards of \\(\\alpha\\) = .05 and power = .80, this leaves the smallest effect size of interest as the main decision you must make. Choosing an effect size is the hardest part of power analysis, but there is no one correct answer, only a difference between justified and unjustified. In your power analysis, we care more about your justification for your choice of effect size rather than the value itself.\nYou could always aim for a tiny effect size but in a real study you are trying to compromise between an informative study and the resources (time / money) you have available. You could always aim for a large effect size, but you might miss potentially informative smaller effects. This means you must choose your smallest effect size of interest based on your understanding of the topic area and consider what effects you would not want to miss out on.\nThere are different strategies for choosing a smallest effect size of interest (see Lakens, 2022 for a full discussion):\n\nIndividual published studies: What effect sizes do similar studies to yours report?\nMeta-analyses: What is the average effect size across several studies on a topic?\nEffect size distributions: For a given topic, what is the distribution of effect sizes for what is considered small, medium, and large?",

    "text": "14.4 Reporting your power analysis\nIf you do report a power analysis, think about what information would allow the reader to reproduce your power analysis and understand your justification behind each input. Bakker et al. (2020) reviewed power analyses reported in pre-registrations and review boards and highlighted the most common omissions. From a sample of 210 studies, the most common omissions (% is the percentage of studies missing the information) in the features of a power analysis were:\n\nSidedness of the test (78%)\nJustification for effect size (45%)\nType of effect size (30%)\nAlpha value (29%)\nValue of effect size (15%)\nPower / beta value (15%)\nSample size (8%)\n\nBakker et al. observed that the most common omission was whether researchers assumed a one- or two-tailed test and the least common omission was the sample size the power analysis suggested.\nPreviously, we highlighted that Mehr et al. does not provide a complete example of reporting a power analysis. As an activity, we would like you to work through different adaptations we prepared and indicate what information you think is included and what you think is missing. Each adaptation is hidden behind a “show me” tab, so you can view each one in turn and focus on asking yourself what information is missing. We will compare each adaptation side by side afterwards.\n\n14.4.1 Adaptation one\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me the first adaptation\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the field standards of power = .80 and alpha = .05, and an effect size from previous studies, we will require 29 infants in our study.\n\n\n\nIn adaptation one, what information do you think is missing?\n\n\nSidedness of the test? \nIncluded\nMissing\n\n\n\n\n\nJustification for effect size? \nIncluded\nMissing\n\n\n\n\n\nType of effect size? \nIncluded\nMissing\n\n\n\n\n\nAlpha value? \nIncluded\nMissing\n\n\n\n\n\nValue of the effect size? \nIncluded\nMissing\n\n\n\n\n\nPower / beta value? \nIncluded\nMissing\n\n\n\n\n\nSample size? \nIncluded\nMissing\n\n\n\n\n14.4.1.1 Adaptation two\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me the second adaptation\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious related research looking into how infants can develop and show selective-attention suggested a medium sized effect.

The justification for the effect size could be more detailed and there are some subtle details Bakker et al. (2020) did not assess in their review. For example, you could mention the statistical test it is based on for absolutely clarity, and justify using the field standard values for alpha and power. To highlight how each adaptation changes, we will start with number one which included the fewest details and it would be difficult to reproduce the power analysis.\n\nUsing the field standards of power = .80 and alpha = .05, and an effect size from previous studies, we will require 29 infants in our study.\n\nWe only have the field standards of 80% power, 5% alpha, and we need 29 participants. There is no mention of the effect size, no justification, and no mention of the test it is based on.\nAdding bold to adaptation two, we add more details.\n\nPrevious related research looking into how infants can develop and show selective-attention suggested a medium sized effect. As such, using the field standards of power = .80 and alpha = .05, and d = 0.54, we will require 29 infants in our study.\n\nWe mention studies on this topic report a medium sized effect, so that could be our smallest effect size of interest. We then specify an effect of d = 0.54 to add another input for our power analysis. However, we are vague about the studies that report the effect and there is no mention of the test or the number of tails it is based on.\nAdding a final round of bold to adaptation three, we add a few more details.\n\nPrevious related research looking into how infants can develop and show selective-attention through music (Mehr et al., 2016) and language (Kinzler et al., 2007) suggested a medium sized effect around d = 0.54. As such, using the field standards of power = .80 and alpha = .05, and the suggested effect size from previous studies, we will require 29 infants in our study for a two-tailed test.\n\nThis time, the explanation could be more detailed for why this value represents the smallest effect size of interest, but we outlined studies to support this decision. We add the number of tails the power analysis is based on at the end, but we do not outline specifically what statistical test it is applied to.",

    "section": "\n14.5 A priori vs sensitivity power analysis",
    "text": "14.5 A priori vs sensitivity power analysis\nOne common question we receive is: “what happens if we do not get the sample size we need from the final data?”. Typically in research, an a priori power analysis is most effective during the design phase. You have the opportunity to design your study and calculate how many participants you must recruit for your desired level of sensitivity, keeping in mind the resources you have available. At this point, you collect data and try to recruit as many participants as your power analysis suggested.\nFor different reasons, your final sample size might be different to the sample size you planned on recruiting. The final sample size could be smaller as you found it more difficult to recruit participants for your target population or there was more missing data than you expected. Alternatively, the final sample size could be larger as more people responded to the advert than you were anticipating. This does not mean your a priori power analysis was a waste of time, but you can consider the difference between your planned sample size and your final sample size.\n\n14.5.1 Example from published research\nFor a nice example from a published study, Wingen et al. (2020, pg. 455) commented on the difference between their planned and final sample size:\n\n“The sample size was set to 266, based on an a priori power analysis for 95% power (one-sided \\(\\alpha\\) of .05) to detect a small to moderate effect of r = .2, that would be typical for similar social psychological research (Richard, Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003). The final sample was slightly larger as is often the case in online studies and consisted of 271 participants (54.3% male; age: M = 33.7 years, SD = 8.9). No participants were excluded from the analyses. A sensitivity analysis showed that our final sample had a high chance (1 - \\(\\beta\\) = .80, one-sided \\(\\alpha\\) = .05) to detect a correlation of r = .15 and a very high chance (1 - \\(\\beta\\) = .95, one-sided \\(\\alpha\\) = .05) to detect r = .20.”\n\nTheir original power analysis suggested they needed 266 participants to detect their smallest effect size of interest. They recruited 271 participants instead, so they commented on what effect size their study would be sensitive to for two values of power.\n\n14.5.2 Mock example with R code and output\nFor an additional example, let’s imagine we were building on the Mehr et al. example we have worked with throughout this section. We can calculate power for a paired samples t-test as above with a smallest effect size of interest of d = 0.54, 84% power, 5% alpha, and a two-tailed test.\n\npwr.t.test(d = 0.54,\n           sig.level = .05,\n           power = .84,\n           type = \"paired\",\n           alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n     Paired t test power calculation \n\n              n = 31.91057\n              d = 0.54\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.84\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number of *pairs*\n\n\nThe a priori power analysis shows we would need to recruit 32 infants to be consistent with our power analysis. However, perhaps we had trouble recruiting infants and we had technical troubles meaning we lost some data. What effect size could we detect if our final sample size was 20?\n\npwr.t.test(n = 20,\n           sig.level = .05,\n           power = .84,\n           type = \"paired\",\n           alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n     Paired t test power calculation \n\n              n = 20\n              d = 0.6965685\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.84\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number of *pairs*\n\n\nThis sensitivity power analysis suggests we would be able to detect an effect size of d = 0.70 with 20 participants, 84% power, 5% alpha, and a two-tailed test. This effect size is larger than our smallest effect size of interest, so we would need to consider whether this lower level of sensitivity is informative and whether it was problematic we were less likely to detect effects smaller than d = 0.70.\nFor your assignment, you might find there is a larger difference between your planned and final sample size than a typical study. This is an educational experience where we have collected data for you and we are guiding you through the skills you will need as an independent researcher for your dissertation and beyond. So, report an a priori power analysis in your stage one report (or stage two report if you do not cover everything in time) based on your smallest effect size of interest, then reflect on what effect size your final sample size and design would be sensitive to detect in your stage two report.",

In any individual study, we have a bunch of observations, calculate a sample statistic, then calculate the p-value. We either reject the null or not, probability does not apply to individual events.

Probability does not apply to how likely/unlikely the null hypothesis is in any one study.

We have also recorded a video walking through the visualisation to use alongside the explanations below:\n\n\nInstead of simulating the behaviour of samples and how they form distributions, this time we are exploring how the four main concepts of hypothesis testing fit together. At the end of part 1 in the lecture, we explained how if you state three of the concepts, you can calculate the fourth. For example, in power analysis, you can calculate how many participants you need based on a given alpha, beta/power, and smallest effect size of interest. Decision making is critical when using hypothesis testing as it’s designed to limit the errors you make when rejecting the null hypothesis or not. Hopefully, you will see the implications of these decisions when playing around with the visualisation.\nYou can choose from the four main hypothesis testing concepts as the one to solve for:\n\nPower: What power do we have for a given alpha, sample size, and effect size? In reality, this is not useful and is known as post-hoc power. When applied to an individual study, it’s an attractive idea, but it omits the long-run aspect of the probability and mistakes the sample estimate for the population value.\nAlpha: What would be the type I error rate for a given power, sample size, and effect size? Like power, this is not normally what you are interested in for the output.\nn: What sample size would we need for a given power, alpha, and effect size? This is the traditional sense of power analysis where we calculate the number of participants we need to conduct an informative study, given your inputs.\nd: What effect size could you detect for a given power, alpha, and sample size? This is the second type of informative output known as a sensitivity power analysis. If you have a known sample size, you can calculate what was the smallest effect size you could reliably detect, given your inputs.\n\nThis visualisation is a useful educational exercise for seeing how the inputs change the output. Just keep in mind it’s aimed at a very limited application, we do not recommend using the sample size output to report for a power analysis. There is a chapter in the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis dedicated to power analysis.\nThere is also a button to toggle a one- or two-tailed test. This is useful for seeing how the area of the null distribution changes depending on whether you spend all the alpha in one tail or two.",

    "text": "16.1.1 Aim\n\nWrite precisely and accurately and choose the word/phrase that best expresses your idea.\nUse technical language, with clear definitions where necessary.\nUse short sentences and straightforward sentence structures where possible.\nWrite in a clear, accessible style. Remember, the point of scientific writing is to clearly convey information, not to entertain or to show off your vocabulary.\n\n16.1.2 Try to avoid\n\nColloquial or conversational English.\nUnnecessarily complex language and unnecessary “rhetorical flourishes” such as irony, ambiguity (intentional or otherwise), and informal language.\nAsking rhetorical questions. The purpose of a report or essay is to explain to the reader what something means, not pose a question back at them.\nContractions such as ‘can’t’, ‘don’t’ or ‘isn’t’ - always use the full phrase.\n\n16.1.3 Top Tips to improve your writing\n\nDo not submit the first draft. No-one ever writes anything good on the first attempt. Good writing is all in the editing process, the first draft is just about getting your ideas on the page. We once saw the advice (but cannot remember the source): “the first draft is explaining your ideas to yourself, the editing is about explaining your ideas to the reader”.\nRead your essay out loud as you will easily spot a horrendously long sentence as you lose your breath trying to read it aloud.\nProof-read after a day or so break. If you are too close to it, you might not spot mistakes or where ideas are not expressed clearly for the naive reader.\nAsk a friend to proof-read. This is particularly helpful if they do not study psychology (or if they are doing a different topic than you) because they will only understand it if you have properly explained your key concepts and if the logic flows.\nRead lots of journal articles as you will start to recognise what works and what does not work for you as the reader, so you can start to reflect it in your own writing.\n\n16.1.4 Further resources\nThe Student Learning Development team have several sources of support available:\n\nYou can book 1-to-1 advice and support sessions.\nThere is additional support available for international students.\nThere are pre-recorded classes in a Moodle course you can self-enrol in.\n\nYou are busy enough on this course, but if you want to work on your academic writing, there is an excellent free course on Coursera called Writing in the Sciences. This has 8 modules covering concepts like effective writing, verbs, and sentence structure.",

    "text": "16.2 Paragraph structure\nOnce you start organising your ideas into writing, its important to consider good paragraph structure. We recommend learning the PEEL approach to paragraphs:\n\nPoint – Your topic sentence or two starts the paragraph to outline the key point you are making. Readers should be able to skim through your writing and recognise from the first sentence or two what the point of each paragraph is.\nEvidence – Once you outlined the point you are making, its time to explain the evidence relating to your point.\nExplain – Now you have presented the evidence, you need to explain what the evidence means for your overall point.\nLink – Finally, in the final sentence or two, you have a summary sentence to wrap up your paragraph and help transition to the next paragraph.\n\nFor an example, we will break down a paragraph from Robertson and Simmons (2013):\n\nThere are a number of neural theories of autism that aim to explain the unusual sensory processing reported within this population. Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) theory (Mottron, Dawson, Soulières, Hubert, & Burack, 2006) is based on the premise that individuals with ASD exhibit superior local processing abilities. This theory proposes that ASD stems from a superiority of low-level perception (such as discrimination and pattern perception), resulting in increased attention to lower order cognitive processes, at the expense of higher order ones (eg social interaction) (Mottron & Burack, 2001). In an update to the Enhanced Perceptual Functioning theory, the authors hypothesised that the superior local processing observed in ASD is a result of mandatory global bias in individuals without ASD, even when it is detrimental to task performance (Mottron et al., 2006). The ‘neural noise hypothesis’ also provides an account for atypical sensory reactivity reported in ASD. The concept of a ‘noisy system’ has been proposed in multiple studies and reviews (Dakin & Frith, 2005; Franklin et al., 2010; Sanchez-Marin & Padilla-Medina, 2008; Simmons et al., 2009) to explain the performance of individuals with ASD. When combined with the evidence of increased heterogeneity in ASD, particularly that of intraparticipant variability (Milne, 2011), it was proposed that neural noise could account for the strengths and impairments observed in ASD (Simmons et al., 2007).\n\n\nPoint\n\nThe first sentence outlines the topic of the paragraph.\n\nThere are a number of neural theories of autism that aim to explain the unusual sensory processing reported within this population.\n\n\nEvidence\n\nWe then add evidence to support this point.\n\nThere are a number of neural theories of autism that aim to explain the unusual sensory processing reported within this population.

It’s perfectly fine to write as much as you can and get your ideas down on a page. However, you then need to go back, proof-read, and edit to make sure your writing is aligned with the PEEL structure.\nKey things to look out for are questioning whether your paragraph contains one key point. If you cannot summarise your paragraph or you are starting to list everything you are covering, its a sign you might need to break down your paragraph into two, and work on new topic and summary/link sentences.\nLikewise, you might see there is a paragraph with just one or two sentences, with little evidence or explanation. This is a sign you might need to add further writing to develop it into a full PEEL paragraph with topic and summary/link sentences.",

    "section": "\n16.3 Using evidence",
    "text": "16.3 Using evidence\nAny report you write as a researcher must be evidence-based, otherwise it would be more of an opinion piece. To show what evidence is behind your claims, you must use citations in your report. In this section, we are focusing on the role of citations and how they show what evidence you are using. In the next section on APA formatting, you will learn more about the specific formatting requirements of the citations.\nIt’s not enough to have a single citation at the end of a paragraph, or even a list of citations randomly put in. Every fact, point, and evaluation is likely to have come from someone else’s work or something that has influenced your thinking, so you should cite that source. You need to ensure that you cite the evidence you are using to make your point.\nTry to put the citation near or next to the point you are making to show where that specific point came from, rather than adding a list of citations at the end and expecting the reader to know which citation relates to each claim.\nCompare these sentences:\n\n“Previous research suggests voices can impact our perception of trust (citation), dominance (citation), and attractiveness (citation)”\n“Previous research suggests voices can impact our perception of trust, dominance, and attractiveness (citation; citation; citation)”\n\nThe first sentence says each paper tested one individual variable (trust, dominance or attractiveness). The second sentence says all three papers tested all three variables. Both can be true but you need to keep in mind how citation placement changes the understanding.\nCitations do not have to go just at the end of a sentence. Use them in different places to create a sense of flow and narrative in your writing. If you only use one style of citation, your writing might be less engaging, so try to switch between direct and indirect citations. For a longer demonstration, we will adapt an extract from the following article:\n\nSilberzahn, R., Uhlmann, E. L., Martin, D. P., Anselmi, P., Aust, F., Awtrey, E., Bahník, Š., Bai, F., Bannard, C., Bonnier, E., Carlsson, R., Cheung, F., Christensen, G., Clay, R., Craig, M. A., Dalla Rosa, A., Dam, L., Evans, M. H., Flores Cervantes, I., … Nosek, B. A. (2018). Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results. Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 1(3), 337–356. https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917747646\n\nThink about how the meaning and clarity of who said what changes with citation placement. If unsure, you want to aim for the first version.\n\nOriginal version with bold added to emphasise cited points (note that their citation format is in APA 6th edition and some citations would be formatted slightly different in the 7th edition):\n\n\n“But what if the methodologists are correct? What if scientific results are highly contingent on subjective decisions at the analysis stage? In that case, the process of certifying a particular result on the basis of an idiosyncratic analytic strategy might be fraught with unrecognized uncertainty (Gelman & Loken, 2014), and research findings might be less trustworthy than they at first appear to be (Cumming, 2014). Had the authors made different assumptions, an entirely different result might have been observed (Babtie, Kirk, & Stumpf, 2014).”\n\n\nEdited version with citations moved in the second sentence to add confusion about who says what:\n\n\n“But what if the methodologists are correct? What if scientific results are highly contingent on subjective decisions at the analysis stage? In that case, the process of certifying a particular result on the basis of an idiosyncratic analytic strategy might be fraught with unrecognized uncertainty and research findings might be less trustworthy than they at first appear to be (Cumming, 2014; Gelman & Loken, 2014). Had the authors made different assumptions, an entirely different result might have been observed (Babtie, Kirk, & Stumpf, 2014).”\n\n\nEdited version with all citations moved to the end creating even more confusion as to who said what:\n\n\n“But what if the methodologists are correct? What if scientific results are highly contingent on subjective decisions at the analysis stage? In that case, the process of certifying a particular result on the basis of an idiosyncratic analytic strategy might be fraught with unrecognized uncertainty and research findings might be less trustworthy than they at first appear to be. Had the authors made different assumptions, an entirely different result might have been observed (Babtie, Kirk, & Stumpf, 2014; Cumming, 2014; Gelman & Loken, 2014).”\n\n\nEdited version with no citations which is now just plagiarism when you are not acknowledging the source of information, either intentionally or not:\n\n\n“But what if the methodologists are correct?

    "section": "\n16.4 APA formatting",
    "text": "16.4 APA formatting\nWhen you are writing a piece of work and use someone else’s ideas or findings, you must reference them and the specific work you are referring to. In psychology, we use the American Psychological Associations’s (APA) reference style (7th edition). APA style also covers other aspects of formatting such as report headings, presenting tables and figures, and numbers, but we will introduce you to that in future weeks.\nYou may have used other referencing systems in your previous degree (e.g., Harvard), but it is important you use APA for psychology in your current degree programme. Remember, a reference manager can really help with the heavy lifting here and do a lot of the formatting. But you still need to know APA 7 style well enough to spot when there might be errors.\nThere are two things to pay attention to, in-text citations and the reference list.\n\n16.4.1 In-text citations\nIn-text citations are a short version of the source you are referring to in the main text. Citations include the author’s surname and the year of publication.\nDirect citations include the authors’ names as part of the sentence, such as “Karpicke and Roediger (2009) argued…”.\nThey do not contain first names and they typically do not contain initials (the only time you include initials is when you have two authors with the same surname you want to distinguish). There is no article title as it takes up a lot of words and you will be able to see the title in the reference list.\nFor a subtle part of APA style, when two authors are part of the sentence, you use “and” rather than “&” to separate the surnames.\nIndirect citations are when you include the authors’ names and year of publication within brackets. You are still acknowledging the source of evidence, but the surnames are not part of the sentence, such as “…there may be socio-motivational benefits of attending (French & Kennedy, 2017), or…”.\nIndirect citations still do not contain first names nor usually include initials, but this time you use “&” rather than “and” to separate two authors. All the names and year are in parentheses, and there is a comma between the final surname and year.\nThere are slightly different formats for citations depending on whether there is one author, two authors, or three or more authors.\n\nOne author: Jackman (2017) or (Jackman, 2017)\nTwo authors: Jackman and Fassbender (2016) or (Jackman & Fassbender, 2016)\nThree or more authors: Rolfe et al. (2010) or (Rolfe et al., 2010)\n\nThis means you always include all the authors when there are one or two people, but three or more is shortened to first author et al., meaning “and others”.\nSometimes, you will include multiple citations in the same parentheses to show the evidence base behind a given point. If you cite two or more studies, they should be in alphabetical order of the author and separated with a semi-colon, such as “(Phillips et al., 2010; Rolfe et al., 2010)”.\nIf you have two or more studies from the same authors (in the same author order), then you order by year of publication, giving the author’s last names once and adding the date of each subsequent work, such as “(Davies, 2008, 2010, 2012)”.\n\n16.4.2 Reference lists\nA reference list is a list of all the sources you cited in your report. In comparison, a bibliography is a list of all the sources you consulted while writing your report, even when you do not cite them.\nIn psychology, you should only provide a reference list where the references are listed in alphabetical order of the first author’s surname. In this course, you will not need to provide a bibliography.\nAs an example, a reference entry should look like this:\n\nFlake, J. K., & Fried, E. I. (2020). Measurement Schmeasurement: Questionable Measurement Practices and How to Avoid Them. Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 3(4), 456–465. https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245920952393\n\nYou start by listing each author by the last name, a comma, their initial(s), and a full stop. Authors are separated by “&”, and after the final author, you include the year of publication in brackets with a full-stop at the end. You have the title of the article which is not in italics. You then have the name of the journal in italics, a comma, and the volume and issue number (in the format “volume number(issue number)”). The issue number is not always available, so you might only include the volume number after the journal name. Finally, you have the page numbers of the article, and DOI (digital object identifier).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe one thing we cannot easily recreate in the chapters here is a final subtle formatting point. In the reference list, each entry has a hanging indent which you can create in Word or Google Docs. For example, see this resource on how to include a hanging indent in Word.\n\n\nThis demonstrated APA referencing for articles with two numbers, but there are two main differences you will come across.\nThe first is when you have three or more authors, each author is separated by a comma, then the final two authors are separated by “&”, such as:\n\nBostyn, D. H., Sevenhant, S., & Roets, A. (2018). Of Mice, Men, and Trolleys: Hypothetical Judgment Versus Real-Life Behavior in Trolley-Style Moral Dilemmas. Psychological Science, 29(7), 1084-1093. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797617752640\n\nThe second is when there are many authors. If there are more than 20 authors, the first 19 are reported, you include an ellipsis (…) to show there is a gap, then you report the final author in the list. For example:\n\nEbersole, C. R., Atherton, O. E., Belanger, A. L., Skulborstad, H. M., Allen, J. M., Banks, J. B., Baranski, E., Bernstein, M. J., Bonfiglio, D. B. V., Boucher, L., Brown, E. R., Budiman, N. I., Cairo, A. H., Capaldi, C. A., Chartier, C. R., Chung, J. M., Cicero, D. C., Coleman, J. A., Conway, J. G., … Nosek, B. A. (2016).

Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 67, 68–82. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2015.10.012\n\n\n16.4.3 Further resources\nThe APA style manual has over 700 pages, so we are not going to cover every type of resource. We have covered journal articles in detail, and the other two sources you will cite most often are books and websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry this\n\n\n\nIf you needed to cite and reference a book or website, how would you do it? Search the APA style resources to check what information you would need to include compared to a journal article.\n\n\nThere is an APA style website where they have two super useful pages:\n\nReference examples - This page shows examples of citations and references for different sources.\nThe APA style blog - The blog is a useful resource as it includes short articles where people ask questions on how they can format and style certain information. This can be useful for new technology or resources as they cover it before a new edition of the full style guide will be released.",

For your stage two report, your hypothesis should be the exact same one as you predicted in your group for the stage one report (if you had one in the first place). We promote initiatives like registered reports to avoid this kind of thing as changing your hypothesis risks HARKing - hypothesising after the results are known.\nSome things we recommend here you might not see in published articles. It’s rare to see articles restate the hypothesis in the results section after already including it in the introduction, but just because published research could be presented better does not mean we want to reinforce bad habits.\nRestating the hypothesis helps the reader as they might not have remembered it from the introduction, so after reading the method, they might have to skip back to the introduction to remind themselves.

However, outlining your plan ahead of time means you can stick to it if you still think your plan is appropriate, or you are forced to explain and justify changes to your plan. If you have no deviations to note and you approached the data analysis in the same way you outlined in the stage one report, then you do not need this section.\nFor communication, avoid referring readers back to the stage one report as a means to cut words.

When there are strict word counts, this is something people see as expendable, particularly if all the assumption checks past, so it is rare to see unless the authors had to deal with a specific problem.\nWhen we use statistical tests, they make assumptions about the data you are putting into them to behave as intended and give you accurate inferences. This content can be quite short, but we want to see which assumptions you tested, how you tested them, and what the outcome was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou need to explain which assumptions you checked, how you checked them, and whether they passed the checks, but you do not need to provide long explanations of what the assumptions are. You are working to a word count, so you can assume the reader knows what the assumptions are, you are just telling them whether you consider them to hold or not.\n\n\nFor example, if you intended to perform a Pearson’s correlation or simple linear regression, you would check for normality of residuals, interval-level data, linearity, and homoscedasticity. You would outline how you checked these, such as looking at diagnostic okits, and whether you still think using a parametric test like Pearson’s is appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou check most of the assumptions using diagnostic plots and your own interpretation, so often there is no black and white answer. It is a judgement call that you must be able to explain and justify. The assumptions will never be perfect, so it is not about talking yourself out of using a parametric test, just checking it would be appropriate to use.\n\n\nFor checks that involve diagnostic plots, these are not typically included in the main text. It would take up a lot of space, so you add them to an appendix section and after explaining what you checked and what you conclude, refer the reader to the appendix if they want to look at the diagnostic plots themselves.\nThis section ties into any deviations from the stage one report. In the design and data analysis sub-section, you will have explained what statistical test you planned on using. You did not have the data at that point, so it was only your plan. If you checked the assumptions and that test would no longer be appropriate, you can change it, but you need to explain it is a deviation.",

If the number can be larger than 1, then you include a leading zero (e.g., 0.34). but numbers than cannot be larger than 1 exclude a leading zero (e.g., .34). Use the symbol or abbreviation for statistics if there is a mathematical operator (e.g, M = 6.82, SD = 1.25), where the symbol is in italics. However, if you use the term in the main text, then you write it in full rather than the symbol (e.g., “the mean help-seeking rating was 6.82 (SD = 1.25)”).\nYou can include tables to help report descriptive statistics when there is a lot of information to present and you want to show the values for many variables. For this course and assignment, you almost certainly do not need a table as there is not enough information to present when you only have two variables. On the other hand, figures are always useful to show a plot of your data. For a correlation, this is typically a scatterplot showing the relationship between your two variables.\nWe dedicate the next chapter - Data Visualisation - to guidance on formatting tables and figures in APA style.\n\n17.4.2 Descriptive statistics for t-test / categorical predictors\nIn the context of t-tests and regression with a categorical predictor, it is normally useful to provide the mean and standard deviation (or median and interquartile range) of your groups. This helps to see how your participants responded and whether the initial differences are consistent with what you expected, such as whether one group scored higher on average than the second group.\nYou can include tables to help report descriptive statistics when there is a lot of information to present and you want to show the values for many variables or groups. For this course and assignment, you almost certainly do not need a table as there is not enough information to present when you only have two groups. On the other hand, figures are always useful to show a plot of your data. For a t-test, this is typically a violin-boxplot to show the difference and distribution of data between your two groups.",

Statistical tests have a standardised format in APA style to ensure you report the key information and readers can easily find what they are looking for.\n\n17.5.1 Correlations and continuous predictors\nIf you report a correlation, the individual tests have standardised formatting.\nPearson’s r\nPearson’s r should be reported as follows: r (303) = -.70, 95% CI = [-.75, -.64], p &lt; .001.\nTo break down each component:\n\nr: Symbol for the test statistic in italics\n(303): Degrees of freedom\n-.70: r value reported to 2 decimals with no leading zero\n95% CI = [-.75, -.64]: 95% confidence interval in square brackets to provide the interval estimation\np &lt; .001: p-values reported to three decimals, where p-values smaller than .001 are reported as p &lt; .001, and p-values larger than .001 are written exact, e.g., p = .023.\n\nSpearman’s rho\nSpearman’s rho is almost identical, but you include a subscript to distinguish it from Pearson’s r: \\(r_s\\) (303) = -.68, 95% CI = [-.74, -.61], p &lt; .001.”\n\n\\(r_s\\): Symbol for the test statistic in italics (here with a subscript to identify it as Spearman’s)\n(303): Degrees of freedom\n-.68: r value reported to 2 decimals with no leading zero\n95% CI = [-.75, -.61]: 95% confidence interval in square brackets to provide the interval estimation\np &lt; .001: p-values reported to three decimals, where p-values smaller than .001 are reported as p &lt; .001, and p-values larger than .001 are written exact, e.g., p = .023.\n\nWhen describing the results of your statistical test in words, remember to mention whether it is statistically significant or not, and the size and direction of the effect size. For example,\n\nUsing a two-tailed Pearson’s correlation, we found a large significant negative correlation between perceived fairness and satisfaction and support for wealth redistribution, r (303) = -.70, 95% CI = [-.75, -.64], p &lt; .001.\n\nWe explain we used a two-tailed test, we used Pearson’s r as the statistical test, it is described as significant to conclude we rejected the null hypothesis, and it is a large negative correlation to comment on the strength and direction of the effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember in the null hypothesis significance testing framework, we use it to help us make decisions. It has it’s limitations, but it’s designed to control error rates in correctly rejecting the null hypothesis or not. You can either conclude it is statistically significant or not statistically significant for a given alpha. You do not describe it as insignificant, and it is not consistent with the philosophy to try and spin a result as “marginally significant”.\n\n\n\n17.5.2 t-tests and categorical predictors\nIf you report a t-test, the individual tests have standardised formatting.\nStudent or Welch’s t-test\nA t-test should be reported as follows: t (33.43) = -3.48, , p = .001, Cohen’s d = 1.13, 95% CI = [0.45, 1.81].\nTo break down each component:\n\nt: Symbol for the test statistic in italics.\n(33.43): Degrees of freedom which will be a whole number for a Student t-test (e.g., 34) but a decimal for a Welch’s t-test (e.g., 33.43).\n-3.48: t value reported to 2 decimals with a leading zero if applicable, including whether it is positive or negative.\np = .001: p-values reported to three decimals, where p-values smaller than .001 are reported as p &lt; .001, and p-values larger than .001 are written exact, e.g., p = .023.\nCohen’s d = 1.12: Your standardised or unstandardised effect size estimate, here the standardised mean difference between groups known as Cohen’s d. Reported to two decimals with a leading zero since it can be greater than 1.\n95% CI = [0.43, 1.81]: 95% confidence interval in square brackets to provide the interval estimation for the effect size you report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDoes it matter if my t-value or effect size is positive or negative? No, it’s the absolute number which shows the size of the effect for a t-test. Both the t-value and effect sizes use group 1 minus group 2 in their equations. So, if group 1 is bigger than group 2, the t-value and effect size will be positive, and if group 2 is bigger than group 1, the t-value and effect size will be negative. The important thing is just be consistent, so if you report a positive t-value, the effect size should also be expressed as a positive difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember in the null hypothesis significance testing framework, we use it to help us make decisions. It has it’s limitations, but it’s designed to control error rates in correctly rejecting the null hypothesis or not.

    "text": "17.7 Bringing it all together\nFor statistical tests like correlations, t-tests, and simple linear regression we cover in RM1, the results section will not be very long. We want you to focus on outlining the key information and interpretation, rather than adding unnecessary words. We can summarise the final three components in a short paragraph for both a correlation and t-test context.\n\n17.7.1 Correlations / continuous predictors\n\nThe mean fairness and satisfaction rating was 3.54 (SD = 2.02) and the mean support for wealth redistribution was 3.91 (SD = 1.15). Figure 1 provides a scatterplot showing a negative relationship between the two variables. Using a two-tailed Pearson’s correlation, we found a large significant negative correlation between perceived fairness and satisfaction and support for wealth redistribution, r (303) = .-70, 95% CI = [-.75, -.64], p &lt; .001. This supports our hypothesis that there would be a relationship between perceived fairness and satisfaction and attitudes on wealth redistribution, suggesting that higher levels of support for wealth redistribution are associated with lower levels of perceived fairness and satisfaction of the current system.\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nScatterplot showing a negative relationship between support for wealth redistribution and perceived fairness and satisfaction of the current system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.7.2 t-tests / categorical predictors\n\nThe mean candidate intellect rating was 5.63 (SD = 1.91) in the audio group and the mean rating in the transcript group was 3.65 (SD = 1.61). Figure 1 provides a violin-boxplot showing the difference between the two groups. We found recruiters who listened to an audio recording rated the candidate’s intellect as 1.99 units higher (95% CI = [0.83, 3.15]) than recruiters who read a transcript, where a two-tailed Welch’s t-test was statistically significant, t (33.43) = 3.48, p = .001, Cohen’s d = 1.12, 95% CI = [0.43, 1.81]. This supports our hypothesis that there would be a difference in intellect ratings between recruiters who hear an audio recording or read a transcript.\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nA violin-boxplot showing higher candidate intellect ratings in the audio group compared to the transcript group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nShould I report the mean difference or Cohen’s d for the standardised mean difference? There are different arguments around which effect sizes are most useful, so there is nothing wrong with reporting both if you have the space. Unstandardised effects are easier to understand and in the original units of measurement, meaning it is easier to compare between similar studies. Standardised effect sizes can - in theory - be used to compare effects from different measure and are useful for future power analyses, so it can be useful for the reader to report both. If you need to report just one, think which one will be most useful when it comes to putting your effect size in context in the discussion.\n\n\nAs a parting note, remember we outline these six key components to help you present the key information and inferences to your reader, but there is no one single correct way of presenting the information. The previous paragraph was only an example, and providing you include the key information with appropriate APA formatting and maintain logical flow, there are equally valid ways of presenting your results.",

    "text": "18.1 The role of data visualisation and formatting\nFirst, data visualisation is important for you as the researcher. Exploratory data analysis should be the first step in your data analysis toolkit to see what your data look like, check for potential problems, and identify initial patterns.\nTo demonstrate why this is important, the dinosaur dozen shows how the same summary statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) can be identical but result from dramatically different data patterns. For example, creating a graph of a star, a cross, and yes, even a dinosaur can have the same underlying mean, standard deviation, and correlation. Yanai and Lercher (2020) found that students would not recognise an image of a gorilla recreated as data points when they were focused on rushing to apply a statistical test. Therefore, exploratory data analysis is important in the initial steps of data analysis to check what patterns are present and if the data properties are consistent with what you expect.\nSecond, data visualisation is important for your reader. Visualisations can communicate your message more effectively than a written summary or a wall of numbers, but it is crucial to balance efficiency with transparency. It can be easy to confuse or mislead people with poorly designed visualisations.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "18.1.1 Data visualisation principles\nEffective (or misleading) data visualisation is a whole field of study, so we will just outline a few key principles to keep in mind when designing your plots to help communicate your data as effectively and honestly as possible. If this is something that interests you, we recommend chapter one - looking at data - from Data Visualisation by Healy (2018) and the comprehensive review article The Science of Visual Data Communication: What Works by Franconeri et al. (2021) for further reading.\n\n18.1.1.1 Visual illusions\nYour visual system is pretty powerful and allows you to rapidly search for patterns in visual information. But for the same reasons that make graphs effective at communicating information, design features can also play tricks on the visual system and create illusions.\nWithin the bar bias\nBar plots are extremely common to see in journal articles and the media as they are easy to interpret. They are designed to communicate frequencies or percentages of observations where the top of each bar corresponds to the frequency of each variable or level you are plotting. Bar plots visualise frequencies well but they should not be used to summarise averages of continuous data, such as the mean of different groups. As the height of the bar only corresponds with the value of the mean, it hides other information like the distribution of observations behind the mean, and perception research shows people mistakenly think values within the bars are more likely than values outside the bars.\nFor example, the bars in A below look identical when you just plot the means, but if you superimpose the data points in B, it shows a very different underlying pattern. This shows why it is important to consider what type of plot would effectively communicate the data you are working with and it is best to use something like a violin-boxplot for continuous outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY-axis truncation\nOne of the most powerful and most common illusions that can mislead people is truncated or non-zero axes, where (typically) the y-axis is shortened to zoom in on a smaller range of values. Franconeri et al. (2021) discuss studies that show people overestimate differences between two groups when you tell them the truncation is present and even if you get people to manually enter the values from each bar. For example, the bar plot below shows the same difference across the full 0 to 100 scale (A), then truncated between 45 and 60 to highlight the difference (B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is another area where it takes time and experience to recognise where y-axis trunctation is misleading or not. Although we are not trying to turn this into a bar plot witch hunt, as a general rule of thumb, its usually not a good idea to truncate the y-axis of a bar plot as they are meant to display frequencies with a logical zero point. On the other hand, its acceptable to truncate line plots as they are designed to show changes across time.\nColour-vision impairments\nOne important design feature is how you will distinguish between different elements of your graph. Colour can be used to effectively code different groups or conditions, but many analysts do not think carefully about colour combinations. Colour-vision impairments affect a significant number of people, so it is important to consider whether someone who is colour blind could distinguish between groups/conditions and understand the message you are trying to communicate. In the plot below, on the top (A) is a scatterplot using green and purple, which can look identical for some types of colourblindness. On the bottom (B) is the same scatterplot using a colour blind friendly palette of greens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.1.2 Highlight comparisons of interest\nIf you create plots with multiple variables, you will have control over which variable you place on the x-axis and which you place on the legend. It is important to think about which comparison you want your readers to make. Comparing features is a serial process which takes time and working memory, so your readers’ eyes must move between the different components and consider which are higher or lower as they move around the graph. This means you should make it easier for your readers to make the key comparisons by using connectivity and proximity.\nIn the graph below, there are two ways of presenting the same data. In plot A, condition is on the x-axis while language is a grouping variable. In plot B, these are flipped with language on the x-axis and condition as a grouping variable. When creating this plot, you would need to consider whether you want to draw people’s attention to the comparison between language groups or between the word/non-word conditions.\nIf you wanted to emphasise the difference between conditions, then plot A forces people to shift their attention back and forth between non-word and word conditions across the whole plot. Compare this to plot B where the two conditions are placed side by side. In this version, it is much easier to compare the two conditions as they are proximal to each other. If you wanted to emphasise language, then the opposite would apply with plot A having language proximal to each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.1.3 Guide viewers to your conceptual message\nFinally, it is important to respect associations between visualisation designs and data types. When interpreting plots, people rely on schemas to interpret the information they are presented. These associations are relatively universal like top vs bottom for the position (closer to the top means a greater value) and light vs dark for luminescence (darker colours on a light background means a greater value). Similarly, plot types are designed to work with certain combinations of data, like a bar plot uses categorical variables for bars and the bar height shows frequencies or your outcome. When you go against these schemas, it can be deeply confusing for your reader.\nThis is another area where subject knowledge is important as some disciplines have their own conventions which can change over time. For example, in EEG research (Electroencephalography - where brain activity is measured with electrodes stuck to the scalp) it was conventional to plot amplitude with negative values at the top and positives values at the bottom (plot A below). This can look a little odd to those unfamiliar with EEG data and breaks conventional understanding that top means higher numbers. Over time though, this convention has changed and more studies report amplitude with positive values at the top (plot B below). This shows how conventions change over time and it is important to keep your audience in mind to make your data visualisation as accessible and intuitive as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.2 Formatting tables\nAfter working through some data visualisation principles, it is time to highlight key APA formatting details if you want to include them in your report.\nTables are designed to efficiently communicate a large amount of data, when it would take too long to outline in the main text. So, the first key consideration of a table is whether you need one at all. If you are only reporting a few numbers or you include them all in the main text anyway, you do not need a table.\nIf you do have enough information to communicate, then an APA formatted table looks like the figure below and includes the following features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be numbered sequentially for the order you place it in the report (e.g., Table 1 comes before Table 2).\nIt includes an informative title in italics to explain to the reader what information it contains.\nThe row and column headers are informative, so the reader can understand the table in isolation.\nThere are no vertical lines and you limit borders to those needed for clarity.\nIf you need to provide further information, you can include a note below the table, such as if you need to define abbreviations. This is not always applicable.\n\nFor full details, the APA style website has a great page on the key features of an APA formatted table.\n\n18.1.3 Formatting figures\nIn contrast to tables, figures are always useful to help communicate your findings and supplement any statistics you report. We recommend including a figure for each main analysis or component of the analysis.\nNote they are called figures and not numbered plots or graphs in APA style. Figure is a more general term as it could contain a plot, a screenshot, or a drawing depending on what you need to communicate your reader. Essentially, it could be anything other than a table, but most of the time in a psychology report you will be communicating a plot.\nAn APA formatted figure looks like below and includes the following features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigures should be numbered sequentially for the order you place them in the report (e.g., Figure 1 comes before Figure 2), and they are number separately to tables (i.e., you can have both a Table 1 and Figure 1).\nIt includes an informative title in italics to explain to the reader what information it contains.\nYou should edit the axis labels so that readers can understand the figure in isolation.\nIf there are specific features like error bars, you should define what they represent in the title or note.\nIf you need to provide supplementary information, you can include a note below the figure, such as if you need to define abbreviations, but this is not always applicable.\n\nFor full details, the APA style website has a great page on the key features of an APA formatted figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop tip\n\n\n\nTop tip: If you use Word to write your assignments, figure placement can be a nightmare and become separated from the title. So, if you insert a 1x2 table, you can add the figure number and title in the first row and figure image in the second row, then make the borders transparent. This means the title and figure will always be connected.",

If you found different results than previous studies, are there key differences in your methods that might explain those differences?\nDiscussions are quite speculative as you are providing explanations for your findings, but knowledge/research and evaluation skills are still important.

Once you have conducted the study, there is nothing you can do about them. However, no individual study provides the definitive answer to a research question. You must make decisions and often you must make compromises when designing a study.

    "text": "20.1.1 The four validities\nLimitations typically focus on your methods as they are elements you no longer have any control over. Clarke and colleagues have released some excellent articles on limitations in psychology articles and reinforce the idea of the four validities. These are not exhaustive and there are some limitations which cannot be classified this way, but we think it is a good way to develop an appreciation of what limitations are and provide inspiration for what features you might identify as limitations.\nWe covered validity in lecture 2 alongside research design and reliability. Validity relates to the truth of an inference (Clarke et al., 2023), meaning how confident you can be in the conclusions you made from a given finding. The four validities relate to different elements that affect that confidence:\n\nExternal validity - how generalisable you think a finding is.\nConstruct validity - how well a measure or manipulation represents a given psychological construct.\nInternal validity - whether there is evidence of a causal relationship between your variables.\nStatistical conclusion validity - whether your statistical approach can provide valid inferential statistics.\n\nBefore we outline the kind of features that you could question as a limitation, Clarke et al. (2024) provide guidance on how to approach identifying limitations:\n\nFocus on your most important limitations - avoid the temptation to list every limitation you can think of. It is not about undermining your study or distracting the reader, but highlighting one or two in detail and do them justice.\nBe specific - avoid generic limitations that could be applied to almost any study. It is important to contextualise the limitation you identified and explain how it affects what you can conclude from your specific study.\nExplain, don’t excuse - You do not need to spin your limitations as a strength (think of a job interview where someone says “I’m too much of a perfectionist”), the critical reader is interested in how you can explain the implications of your limitations for the conclusions you make.\n\nIf you have time, we recommend reading the article from Clarke et al. (2024) in full as they provide advice on better practice in outlining limitations, but for this chapter, we will summarise their key categories.\n\n20.1.1.1 External validity\n\nSelection bias - Did you use a representative sample of your target population in your study? Does your sample not include traditionally underrepresented or understudied populations?\nLimited generalisability across cultures - Can you apply the findings from the cultural context of your study to another cultural context?\nSituation effects - Would you expect the findings to be consistent across new contexts or time periods?\nLow realism - Could your sample setting and choice of measure generalise from your study to your target setting and construct?\nTheoretical generalisability - Does the theory behind your study apply universally to all humans or would it only apply locally to a specific population?\n\n20.1.1.2 Construct validity\n\nConstruct definition errors and ambiguities - Did you clearly define your psychological construct and choose a measure accordingly?\nInsufficient validity evidence - Is there sufficient validity evidence for your measures and/or manipulations?\nUsing measures/manipulations with little or no validation - If you developed a measure/manipulation specifically for your study, is there evidence it is valid and reliable?\nShort measures - If a measure is too short, is this a limitation or is there sufficient validation evidence?\nOver-reliance on self-reports - If you measure your construct with a self-report method, is this the best way to measure your construct?\n\n20.1.1.3 Internal validity\n\nObservational study - If you did not conduct an experiment or provide specific inferential evidence for a causal relationship, how could your inferences be biased by potential confounding variables?\nReverse causation - If you did not provide specific inferential evidence for a causal relationship, how plausible would each direction of the relationship be?\nUnobserved confounding - If you did not provide specific inferential evidence for a causal relationship, what plausible additional confounding variables could there be?\n\n20.1.1.4 Statistical conclusion validity\n\nExploratory research - Are you making strong conclusions based on unplanned analyses with an unknown false positive error rate?\nUnderpowered research - Did you use a sufficient number of participants to detect your smallest effect size of interest?\nWeak statistical evidence - Do your main conclusions rely on weak statistical evidence, such as a p-value very close to your alpha?\nSmall effect sizes - What is the practical significance of your effect size estimate?\n\n20.1.2 Summary\nHopefully, dedicating extra space to identifying limitations provides inspiration for what features of your study could affect confidence in your findings. Remember this is not about intentionally undermining your study, but instilling trustworthiness by realistically adding caveats for what you can and cannot conclude in your study. The four validities popularised by the work of Clarke et al. are meant to provide a starting point and help calibrate your understanding of what a legitimate limitation is. If you can identify a limitation applicable to your study that is not covered here, you can still outline it, but it is important you are specific and support your evaluation with evidence wherever possible.",

    "section": "\n20.2 Structure of the abstract",
    "text": "20.2 Structure of the abstract\nThe abstract is a summary of the entire report. It comes right at the very start and is the first thing people will read. That said, it is normally the last thing that people write as it summarises all the different sections of the report you will have already written.\nThe abstract highlights the key point or points from each section of the report: the introduction, the methods, the results, and the discussion. In other words, Gernsbacher (2018) describes it as “A clear abstract states the study’s primary hypothesis; its major methodology, including its sample size and sampled population; its main findings, along with their summary statistics; and its key implications”. Koopman (1997, cited in Derntl, 2014) suggests the following structure:\n\nMotivation (General Area): Why do we care about the problem and the results?\nProblem (Aim of Paper - Research Question): What problem is the paper trying to solve and what is the scope of the work?\nSolution (Methods): What was done to solve the problem?\nResults: What is the answer to the problem?\nImplications: What implications does the answer imply?\n\nIdeally, you are looking for one or two sentences from each of the different sections. You do not normally just copy and paste a sentence from each part, rather summarising the key information from each part. Remember this is a rough guide for how much detail you need. It would not be a problem if you need three sentences to outline a key component, but you probably do not need six sentences for each. We will now elaborate on those key areas.\nStart off with the background and rationale\n\nHere you are looking for one or two sentences giving the brief background of the study for what we know, then the main problem you wanted to address or issues in the current field - basically your rationale for the current study. This provides an insight into the research question for your study.\n\nThe method\n\nThis is not a highly detailed summary, rather an overview of your approach, stating things like the number of participants, who were they, and what they did.\n\nThe Results\n\nState the main findings and what tests you used. We tend not to outline all the numbers in an abstract, but it can be useful to report key effect sizes. Think of it like a short version of how you would start the discussion section.\n\nBrief interpretation or implications of the study\n\nYou are looking to cover the main outcome of your study, trying to relate that back to theory or the main issue you wanted to address - your rationale. See it as “closing the loop” to see if you addressed your research question.\nTry and avoid ending on limitations as these will be covered in your report. The main point of this final component is to briefly relate your findings to previous research and theory.\nIt is also a waste of words to end on something uninformative like “the implications of the results will be discussed”. We would consider this a given, so try and offer the reader something concrete.\n\nFor some final formatting advice, it is normally written as one paragraph approximately 200-250 words long. For an APA style report:\n\nIt will appear on the first page after your title page.\nWe recommend the single paragraph approach, but some journals request a “structured” abstract where the key components are broken down into little headers. For this course, we would like you to start learning the key components and write it as a single paragraph, but we want to make you aware there are differences in style.\nIt should have the title at the top of the abstract. The title does not count in the 200-250 words.\nYou do not need to add keywords at the end of the abstract. You will see these included in some journal articles, but you do not need them for a student report.\n\n\n20.2.1 Breaking down an example abstract\nLooking at examples can help show how the ideas build up. Here is an adapted example from Tsantani et al (2016) broken down to highlight the key components.\n\n20.2.1.1 Background and rationale\n\nVocal pitch has been found to influence judgments of perceived trustworthiness and dominance from a novel voice. However, the majority of findings arise from using only male voices and it is unclear how the pitch of female voices affects judgements of trust and dominance. Here we explore the influence of average vocal pitch on first-impression judgments of perceived trustworthiness and dominance and hypothesise that there will be a preference for low-pitched voices in both genders regardless of judgement.\n\n\n20.2.1.2 Methods\n\nVocal pitch has been found to influence judgments of perceived trustworthiness and dominance from a novel voice. However, the majority of findings arise from using only male voices and it is unclear how the pitch of female voices affects judgements of trust and dominance. Here we explore the influence of average vocal pitch on first-impression judgments of perceived trustworthiness and dominance and hypothesise that there will be a preference for low-pitched voices in both genders regardless of judgement. 40 pairs of high- and low-pitched temporally reversed recordings of male and female vocal utterances were presented in a two-alternative forced-choice task to 40 participants.\n\n\n20.2.1.3 Results\n\nVocal pitch has been found to influence judgments of perceived trustworthiness and dominance from a novel voice. However, the majority of findings arise from using only male voices and it is unclear how the pitch of female voices affects judgements of trust and dominance. Here we explore the influence of average vocal pitch on first-impression judgments of perceived trustworthiness and dominance and hypothesise that there will be a preference for low-pitched voices in both genders regardless of judgement.40 pairs of high- and low-pitched temporally reversed recordings of male and female vocal utterances were presented in a two-alternative forced-choice task to 40 participants. Through a series of t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, we found a tendency for participants to select the low-pitched voice over the high-pitched voice as more trustworthy, for both genders, and more dominant, for male voices only.\n\n\n20.2.1.4 Implications\n\nVocal pitch has been found to influence judgments of perceived trustworthiness and dominance from a novel voice. However, the majority of findings arise from using only male voices and it is unclear how the pitch of female voices affects judgements of trust and dominance. Here we explore the influence of average vocal pitch on first-impression judgments of perceived trustworthiness and dominance and hypothesise that there will be a preference for low-pitched voices in both genders regardless of judgement. 40 pairs of high- and low-pitched temporally reversed recordings of male and female vocal utterances were presented in a two-alternative forced-choice task to 40 participants. Through a series of t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, we found a tendency for participants to select the low-pitched voice over the high-pitched voice as more trustworthy, for both genders, and more dominant, for male voices only. We propose that an overall preference for low pitch is a default prior in male voices irrespective of context, whereas pitch preferences in female voices are more context- and situation-dependent. The present study confirms the important role of vocal pitch in the formation of first-impression personality judgments and advances understanding of the impact of context on pitch preferences across genders.\n\n\n20.2.2 Conclusion\nThis is our advice to learn the key components to include in an abstract. However, you will see a lot of variation in how people approach writing abstracts and standards have changed over time. For example, it was rare to include the sample size of your study, but this is now considered essential to include in the abstract. So, while we recommend looking over abstracts in articles from your literature review to develop a sense of style, try and do so critically as they might not be great examples.",
