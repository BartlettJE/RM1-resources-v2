You do not have to use all the different sources of support, and some will work better for you than others will. Part of learning is about finding what helps you best. Below are a few of the main approaches we have on this course to help you and if in doubt, please just ask:\n\nWeekly lab sessions with your tutor with time for questions in each lab;\nGraduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) support sessions in-person and online;\nTeams channel for discussion, questions, and support;\nStudent Office Hours (sometimes called Student Drop-in Hours) - just turn up and ask anything;\nAssessment information sheets and common questions and answer documents to support assignments.\n\nThe best approach is to write down your questions when they come up, check the available material for answers, and if you are still unsure after that, use one of the approaches above.\nHowever, please note we would ask that you do not send questions, either about a topic or an assignment, as a direct message on Teams to an individual staff member. While we always want to help, this approach is not sustainable and there is a highly likely chance your question will get missed and go unanswered. We would strongly encourage you to post the question on the course Team channel, as that way staff and students have the opportunity to answer your question, and other students can benefit from the answer. Alternatively, use the student office hours or your lab sessions to ask questions more privately."

These walk through learning R/RStudio and applying data skills such as wrangling data, visualisation, and inferential statistics. However, we appreciate you may have questions or encounter errors you cannot work out on your own. That is why we schedule weekly support sessions with our GTAs.\nThe GTA support sessions are drop-in sessions, meaning they are not timetabled classes you must attend. They are there to go to if you have a problem, and you can come and ask questions. Our GTAs may demonstrate techniques or how to fix problems, but they are not intended to be chapter walkthroughs. The idea is you engage in self-directed study, and then you can come to the support sessions if you encounter problems.\nEarly in the semester, the support sessions have open invites. This means anyone can drop in and there might be a handful of students present and asking questions. However, as we approach key assessment periods, the sessions will have specific sign up slots to ensure the GTAs can provide clearly defined equitable time to each sign-up."

We work through chapters 1 to 11 in RM1, then you will continue with chapters 12 to 14 in RM2.\nData skills takes time and trial and error to learn. We direct you to one or two chapters per week to develop your initial skills. Each chapter has a range of “try this” activities to apply what you learnt and check your answers against solutions. We also have “error mode” activities to get you used to making errors in coding. This can be the most intimidating part of learning to code but experienced coders do not stop making mistakes, they just get better at diagnosing and fixing their mistakes. Finally, we have data analysis journey chapters. These provide longer less structured activities to get you wrangling, visualising, and/or analysing data sets. These are meant as the bridge between the core chapters to your assessments where you no longer have solutions to check your answers against."

    "text": "3.1 General information\nWe use the group work agreement to outline how you and your group will work and communicate with each other, and ensure you are engaging in the group work process for the stage one group report. Groups typically experience problems when communication and task responsibilities are built on unspoken assumptions. As you probably do not know the people in your group when we make the allocations, we start the project by facilitating a discussion with you and your group so you can openly outline how you will communicate, respect diversity, and split tasks.\n\nThis is a formative task and is not part of the summative assessment for the course, but everyone must complete the task. We use the group work agreement as a way of identifying engagement and potential problems as early as possible. The course or programme leads will contact students who do not submit their group work agreement and students will potentially be placed on an individual submission if they do not engage with their groups.\nThe deadline is October 11th 2024, where everyone in the group must submit an individual signed copy of the agreement you worked on.\nAlthough you will agree on the document as a group, each group member must then individually sign (electronic or a printed name, you do not need to physically sign it) and upload a copy to the submission portal.\nYou should submit a single Word document (.docx) or PDF document to Moodle prior to the deadline. The submission link is open from when the group allocations are available in week 2. You can find the submission portal in the Formative: Allocations and group work agreement submission tab."

Here is a list of items you may want to discuss with your group and add to the document:\n\nWe all agree to establish a common timeline for the project and discuss any deviations from the timeline together as a group.\nWe all agree to communicate with each other openly and honestly about the project and get in touch with the course leads in the event of an unsolvable group conflict.\nWe all agree to respect each other’s individual ways of working and discuss these openly as a group.\nWe all agree to respect diversity in our group. This includes cultural differences, neurodiversity, different work/life situations and may manifest in different ways of working/approaching tasks. We agree to discuss our strengths as a group and divide tasks accordingly.\nI agree to stay in touch with the group and communicate as established by the group.

    "text": "3.3 Effective group work advice\n\n3.3.1 Guidelines\nBelow are some guidelines to organise and manage your group project for the stage one report. You are welcome to adapt some of these guidelines to suit your group and the nature of the project. However, in the event we need to mediate difficulties, this will involve you providing evidence as record/evidence of collaboration (or lack thereof). Please be mindful of this when conducting your project.\nSet up your group Teams chat/channel and a Microsoft Planner for your group\n\nDO: Create a Teams chat for communication with your group.\nDO: Create a Microsoft Planner with all members of your group to assign individual tasks (we recommend copying this Planner template for the stage one group report we have created. Please copy the Planner, do not edit it.).\nDON’T: Use WhatsApp, Facebook or WeChat etc. to coordinate your project as that excludes people who cannot access this technology in some countries.\n\nCoordinate work schedules/calendars\n\nDO: Be open about when you can meet/study, if you have a busy period coming up, or might be unavailable.\nDO: Schedule a regular ‘check-in’ time. This does not need to be a live meeting but stay connected regularly.\nDON’T: Commit to meetings/time frames that will not work for your timetable or work schedule.\n\nAgree on document collaboration platforms\n\nDO: We recommend having a shared OneDrive folder or sharing documents within your Teams channel using the files tab.\nDO: Use track changes and comments on shared documents.\nDO: Think about a shared Zotero, EndNote, or similar reference manager to organise papers.\n\nWork back from the deadline to create milestones\n\nDO: Be mindful of your work/life balance and upcoming busy periods.\nDO: Agree on specific dates to complete your responsibilities.\nDON’T: Leave things to the last minute.\n\nDetermine strengths and assign roles\n\nDO: Consult the Stage one group work planning advice section below to identify the strengths/preferences of your team.\n\nAssign tasks/milestones to roles\n\nDO: Attach names and dates to tasks and assign milestones using the Microsoft Planner template.\nDO: Reassign tasks/adjust deadlines as the project progresses if you need to.\nDON’T: Assign time-sensitive roles that might clash with someone’s known upcoming commitments.\n\nCommunicate, communicate, communicate\n\nDO: Check-in regularly.\nDO: Agree to action points at the end of meetings and put these in writing (e.g., in a shared document / to-do list).\nDO: Let your group know if you are struggling with a task/milestone.\nDO: Be kind and compassionate (to yourself and others).\nDON’T: Take things personally. We all know text/online communication can sound differently from how it is intended.\n\nSubmit your Assessment\n\nDO: Assign one person to prepare and submit the final documents when everyone has approved them. Remember to turn off track changes.\nDO: Give yourself time to look at the Turnitin Report.\nDON’T: Forget to check you are uploading the correct intended file.\n\n3.3.2 Points about inclusivity\nLanguage: Many/most students in this programme are studying in their second, third, or even fourth language. Consider the challenges you might experience if you were studying beyond your first language and be mindful of making implicit judgements about someone’s writing or communication.\nTiming/working patterns: Be mindful that everyone’s work/life balance and commitments are different. Some people prefer studying during traditional working hours, some in the evenings, and others on weekends. Communicate your preferences openly and as a group be as flexible and accommodating as you can. Can the times/days of meetings be flexible if this helps everyone contribute and feel engaged?\nTechnology: The technology/platforms we recommend might not be your favourites, but we recommend them for a reason. These are things we can directly support, and they are the things that we make sure all students in different countries can access. Using some apps/tools can explicitly exclude some members that want to engage and contribute.\nNeurodiversity: Different people work and think in different ways. If someone discloses that they find particular things challenging, or that they are at their best with a particular type of task or activity, consider how you can support/reflect this in the allocation of roles and tasks.\n\n3.3.3 Supporting self-efficacy/group dynamics\nOstracism: Group dynamics can be one of the trickiest things to manage in a project, especially if you feel like you are the “new person” coming into an established group. For the sake of everyone and your project, avoid implicitly or explicitly creating an in-group/out-group situation and ostracising people.\nPositivity: Try to maintain a positive tone about the project, even if you find it challenging. There is a fine line between having a little vent/catharsis and creating an atmosphere of toxic negativity. Some team members might take this to heart more than others and become dispirited about the activity, their abilities, and the completion of the task. If you are feeling frustrated or finding a particular thing challenging, talk to your group and consider seeking advice or support from the teaching team.\nImposter syndrome: It does not matter how we might be coping, sometimes it is impossible to avoid feeling like you or your work might not be good enough. If you are anxious about sharing something with your group, seek feedback from someone you trust first for their advice. Do not be afraid to make mistakes. Think about your shared documents as ‘working drafts’. Do not think you have to be anything other than who you are with your group. The pressure of thinking you must pretend to be a “model” student or meet the perceived expectations of others can get in the way of your being able to contribute your unique skills and experience."

    "text": "3.4 Stage one group work task sharing advice\nAs you start working in your groups, one key decision will be sharing out the tasks equitably. In the stage one report template, there are several sections and sub-sections to complete. For each component, try to summarise the following when you first meet with your group:\n\nWhat information have you already established in that section?\nWhat do you still need to think about for that section?\nHow are you going to find answers to the things you do not yet know?\n\nFor example, you might say for the rationale, research question, and hypothesis component of the introduction:\n\nWhat have you already established?: So far, we know the research question and the hypothesis, and we have a general summary of relevant papers written by the team.\nWhat do we still need to think about?: We do not yet have a fully formed rationale or a solid understanding of the general overview.\nHow will you find answers to things you do not yet know? Helena, James, and Ashley will read the papers that have already been collected and the general literature review. From there, they will try to summarise the rationale so that it builds on what previous research has found. They will then present that to the group for further revision and discussion.\n\nOnce you have done that for each section, go through and answer the following question: Who will lead on each section?\nEach group member should make an equal contribution, but this does not mean every group member works on every section. Some sections might work better with one person leading and another editing, while other sections might work better with several people leading and editing.\nThe introduction is a larger section with fewer clearly segmented tasks, whereas the method is shorter with clearly defined sub-sections. It is important you understand all aspects of the prospect, so we recommend if you work on writing the introduction, you edit or at least proof-read the method, and vice versa.\nFor example, you might separate the tasks as:\n\nIntroduction literature review: Phil, Helena, and Ashley will lead on this section.\nIntroduction rationale, research question, and hypothesis: Helena, James, and Ashley will lead on this section.\nMethod participants: James and Phil will lead on this section.\nMethod materials: James and Wil will lead on this section.\nMethod procedure: Ashley and Sarune will lead on this section.\nMethod design and data analysis: Sarune and Wil will lead on this section.\n\nYou might choose to separate the tasks differently, but this is one suggestion to work through. We support this the Planner template for the stage one group report, so we recommend at least starting with this plan and allocate roles, and then adapt as you need.\nFor this separation or another approach you agree in your group, question what you know, what you still need to think about, and how you will fill in the blanks:\nIntroduction literature review\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nIntroduction rationale, research question, and hypothesis\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod participants\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod materials\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod procedure\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nMethod design and data analysis\n\nWhat have you already established?\nWhat do you still need to think about?\nHow will you fill in the blanks?\n\nWho will lead on each section?\n\nIntroduction literature review:\nIntroduction rationale, research question, and hypothesis:\nMethod participants:\nMethod materials:\nMethod procedure:\nMethod design and data analysis:\n\nYou can either copy and adapt these questions to work on in your own document, copy the Planner template to your own Microsoft University account, or download this template to structure your group discussions."

All the assignments build on each other and information within the formative assignments will help to complete the summative assignments.\nUse the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis data skills book activities to guide you. In almost all cases (apart from where we highlight), the answers to the assignments require using skills that you have already covered in these materials.\nAvoid making changes to the .Rmd file other than to provide answers and your GUID (e.g., avoid deleting backticks, changing code chunk names, not using the file provided). If you edit the file in a way that affects how the .Rmd knits, such as deleting backticks or changing code chunk names, your submission may be invalid and be returned with a H grade.\nPlease pay special attention if the question asks for a specific output, e.g. value or a data_frame. For example, when asked for a value as an output, make sure it is a single value and not a value stored in a data frame. Finally, when altering code inside the code blocks, do not re-order, rename, or remove the code blocks (e.g. T01, T02, etc.). If you do, this will impact your grade and may result in you receiving a H grade for this assignment. If you are unsure about any of these points, please ask a member of staff.\nRead the question carefully and ensure that you provide exactly what we ask you (e.g., code or a single value). Do not deviate from what the question asks. We encourage you to practice different approaches in your own time, but for these assignments you should only do what the questions ask.\nTest that the .Rmd file you are submitting is reproducible after completing it, by “knitting” it as a html file. This also shows what you have accomplished and allows you to spot potential errors. If your code does not knit, this may result in you receiving an H grade for this assignment, so please check carefully.\nA great test of your code is to close R Studio, restart it, open and knit your code, see that it runs, and go through it to make sure you consider the answers to be correct. This will test whether you have remembered to include essential elements, such as libraries, in your code. This does not necessarily mean that your code is correct, only that your code runs. You need to check the output and compare to the question to see that it matches.\nWhen loading in data, you must use a relative path as opposed to an absolute path. Relative would mean having the data file in the same folder as the .Rmd file and just calling the data file when reading it in, e.g. read_csv(\"data.csv\"). Absolute would be using a path specific to the folder structure of your computer, e.g. read_csv(\"C:/JamesComputer/JamesFolder/data.csv\"). Only use relative paths and under no circumstances should you rename the data file from the one we tell you to use. The file name “data.csv” is different from “data (1).csv” and “data_1.csv”. Only use the name we give you.\nThe following functions are considered forbidden and must not appear anywhere in your code at all. Inclusion of them in your code may result in you receiving a H grade for the assignment. The functions are: install.packages(), help(), vignette(), setwd(),help.start(), or View().\nCollate your notes and learn from your mistakes. These assignments are weighted low to give you the space to make mistakes and to not have a major impact on your overall course grade. Try and take advantage of this opportunity to test your skill development and prepare you for the larger report components and your future dissertation."

If it does not match what we expect, then it is wrong. Remember the point is about being reproducible and replicable.

    "text": "5.9 Feedback information\n\n5.9.1 How is this assessment graded?\nEach data skills assignment will have several questions with each question being worth either 1 or 2 points. Your grade will be converted into an alphanumeric grade on the standard Glasgow 22-point Schedule A scale (e.g., a score of 16 = B2).\n\n5.9.2 How will the feedback from this assessment help me in the future?\nThe practical data skills assignments will help you develop your transferable data skills to complete future work that requires working with data, such as your dissertation, and courses or jobs that require such skills. Additionally, as you will see, these skills can be used for tasks such as writing reports, creating reference sections, conducting text analyses and building websites, as well as a wealth of other tasks and is therefore an extremely useful transferable skill. These skills also give you a much deeper understanding of data and research.\n\n5.9.3 What type of feedback will I receive for this assessment?\nFor these assignments, you will get a feedback sheet for each assignment that tells you whether you received full, partial, or no credit for each task/question within the assignment.\nYou will receive individual feedback on each task within an assignment, telling you where your answer was acceptable or telling you what was incorrect about your answer. You will also see the correct answer to each task within an assignment along with a short piece of generic feedback for that task.\nWe will also make a solution to the assignment available that you should compare to your own work to see alternative approaches, or to see where you have gone wrong, and to see what you have done correctly.\n\n5.9.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe assignments will be graded by an experienced member of staff using computer-assisted marking. Note that this is not automated marking as the member of staff has the final say on all submitted answers and checks the process at every step. In the first instance, we compare the output of your answer to the expected output or the code used to the code requested. If these comparisons match then you are given full credit for the task. If your answer does not match what was asked for in the task, then the member of staff manually checks your output to the expected output, or your code to the expected code, and to the question asked, to see if your code/output still answers the question or not. A decision is then made on whether to award full, partial, or no credit for that task.\n\n5.9.5 Can I get more feedback?\nYes! We encourage you discuss your assessment first with the marker or course lead (regardless of what grade you received) and you can do so either by messaging the marker or course lead directly to arrange an appointment. You can also speak to the GTA team about your coding skills for further development. All staff contact details can be found on the University of Glasgow directory.\n\n5.9.6 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded. That said, even if you are unhappy with your grade, your first point of contact should be to arrange an additional feedback meeting with your marker for further discussion to help explain your feedback and grade. Following this, if you still have concerns you should consult the guidance from the SRC which provides a clear explanation of the University appeals procedures."

There are three equally weighted Assessment Criteria (Knowledge and Research, Critical Evaluation, Academic Communication). You can find out more about Schedule A by downloading this PDF but the important thing to help you interpret your feedback is the use of the verbal descriptors, i.e., the words like “excellent” and “good” used to describe different grades. You should look out for these words to help you understand how you performed on each ILO.\n\n6.12.2 Can I get more feedback?\nYou are more than welcome to receive additional feedback after the marking process:\n\nIf you would like to discuss your feedback you should first contact the person that marked your assignment. However, we ask that you wait 24 hours after the release of the feedback before you do so to give you time to fully reflect on the feedback given.\nWhen meeting with the person who marked your assignment, you can discuss feedback and how it relates to your overall grade to help you improve in future assignments. However, do not be worried about attending to discuss how to maintain your standard if you have done better than you expected. You are more than welcome to come discuss any aspect of your feedback or the assignment in general.\nTo help any discussion about your feedback, we would ask that you complete the reflection form available on the Moodle page and send that to the person who marked your assignment as part of the discussion, when arranging a meeting.\n\n6.12.3 How will feedback from this assessment help me in the future?\nPrimarily, the feedback on this assessment will help support the analysis and write-up of the stage two individual report in this course. Additionally, the feedback will help support your qualitative report in RM2, as well as your dissertation and in any future research work you conduct that requires data analysis, decision-making, and evidence-based justification.\n\n6.12.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe first marker for your report will be a member of the research methods team within the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\nFollowing University’s policy, as part of the marking procedures, the assignment marking will be moderated. The moderator will be another member of the research methods team who will moderate a range of work from across the cohort to ensure that appropriate academic standards have been applied in marking the assignments and that they have been applied consistently across the cohort of students being assessed.\n\n6.12.5 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded.

We direct you to one or two chapters per week to develop your initial skills. Each chapter has a range of “try this” activities to apply what you learnt and check your answers against solutions. We also have “error mode” activities to get you used to making errors in coding. This can be the most intimidating part of learning to code but experienced coders do not stop making mistakes, they just get better at diagnosing and fixing their mistakes. Finally, we have data analysis journey chapters. These provide longer less structured activities to get you wrangling, visualising, and/or analysing data sets.

For further information on the individual stage two report, please refer to the Assessment Information Sheet.\nYou should submit a single Word document (.docx) to Moodle prior to the deadline. The submission link will open at least one week prior to the deadline and will be in the Assessment: Stage One Group and Stage Two Individual Reports tab on Moodle.\nAs a formative task and to outline ground rules for working in your group, you will complete and submit a group work agreement. We will introduce this document to you in week 2 when you will know your group allocation, but it will involve agreeing to how you will work in and contribute to your group.

All the assignments build on each other and information within the formative assignments will help to complete the summative assignments.\nUse the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis data skills book activities to guide you. In almost all cases (apart from where we highlight), the answers to the assignments require using skills that you have already covered in these materials.\nAvoid making changes to the .Rmd file other than to provide answers and your GUID (e.g., avoid deleting backticks, changing code chunk names, not using the file provided). If you edit the file in a way that affects how the .Rmd knits, such as deleting backticks or changing code chunk names, your submission may be invalid and be returned with a H grade.\nPlease pay special attention if the question asks for a specific output, e.g. value or a data_frame. For example, when asked for a value as an output, make sure it is a single value and not a value stored in a data frame. Finally, when altering code inside the code blocks, do not re-order, rename, or remove the code blocks (e.g. T01, T02, etc.). If you do, this will impact your grade and may result in you receiving a H grade for this assignment. If you are unsure about any of these points, please ask a member of staff.\nRead the question carefully and ensure that you provide exactly what we ask you (e.g., code or a single value). Do not deviate from what the question asks. We encourage you to practice different approaches in your own time, but for these assignments you should only do what the questions ask.\nTest that the .Rmd file you are submitting is reproducible after completing it, by “knitting” it as a html file. This also shows what you have accomplished and allows you to spot potential errors. If your code does not knit, this may result in you receiving an H grade for this assignment, so please check carefully.\nA great test of your code is to close R Studio, restart it, open and knit your code, see that it runs, and go through it to make sure you consider the answers to be correct. This will test whether you have remembered to include essential elements, such as libraries, in your code. This does not necessarily mean that your code is correct, only that your code runs. You need to check the output and compare to the question to see that it matches.\nWhen loading in data, you must use a relative path as opposed to an absolute path. Relative would mean having the data file in the same folder as the .Rmd file and just calling the data file when reading it in, e.g. read_csv(\"data.csv\"). Absolute would be using a path specific to the folder structure of your computer, e.g. read_csv(\"C:/JamesComputer/JamesFolder/data.csv\"). Only use relative paths and under no circumstances should you rename the data file from the one we tell you to use. The file name “data.csv” is different from “data (1).csv” and “data_1.csv”. Only use the name we give you.\nThe following functions are considered forbidden and must not appear anywhere in your code at all. Inclusion of them in your code may result in you receiving a H grade for the assignment. The functions are: install.packages(), help(), vignette(), setwd(),help.start(), or View().\nCollate your notes and learn from your mistakes. These assignments are weighted low to give you the space to make mistakes and to not have a major impact on your overall course grade. Try and take advantage of this opportunity to test your skill development and prepare you for the larger report components and your future dissertation."

We will check any incorrect answers and if you have used different code that produces what is asked you will still get the mark, however, using different code from the book increases the risk that you will produce a different output to the one intended. We designed these tasks based on what we expect you will have learnt.\nFailure to follow instructions (e.g., writing code when we requested a single value).\nIncluding any forbidden code in your .Rmd file, e.g., install.packages(). You should never write code that would change something on someone else’s machine.\nWe always ask students to use the function read_csv() to load in data, yet students often use read.csv(). There is a difference between the output these create, so always do what the questions ask.\nBe very careful with spelling. For example, UK is not the same as Uk.\nNever do more than what the question asks. We check the output of a task to see that it matches what we expect. If it does not match what we expect, then it is wrong. Remember the point is about being reproducible and replicable. Think of this in terms of you are sending your work to a colleague who expects a certain thing, and if your code works differently, then that is not good practice.\nTry things out in the console and in your own scripts, but only put your final answers in the .Rmd.\nFailing to read your feedback from previous assignments.\nFailing to check that your code knits before submitting it.\nFailing to check that you are submitting the right file.

Additionally, as you will see, these skills can be used for tasks such as writing reports, creating reference sections, conducting text analyses and building websites, as well as a wealth of other tasks and is therefore an extremely useful transferable skill. These skills also give you a much deeper understanding of data and research.\n\n5.10.3 What type of feedback will I receive for this assessment?\nFor these assignments, you will get a feedback sheet for each assignment that tells you whether you received full, partial, or no credit for each task/question within the assignment.\nYou will receive individual feedback on each task within an assignment, telling you where your answer was acceptable or telling you what was incorrect about your answer. You will also see the correct answer to each task within an assignment along with a short piece of generic feedback for that task.\nWe will also make a solution to the assignment available that you should compare to your own work to see alternative approaches, or to see where you have gone wrong, and to see what you have done correctly.\n\n5.10.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe assignments will be graded by an experienced member of staff using computer-assisted marking. Note that this is not automated marking as the member of staff has the final say on all submitted answers and checks the process at every step. In the first instance, we compare the output of your answer to the expected output or the code used to the code requested. If these comparisons match then you are given full credit for the task. If your answer does not match what was asked for in the task, then the member of staff manually checks your output to the expected output, or your code to the expected code, and to the question asked, to see if your code/output still answers the question or not. A decision is then made on whether to award full, partial, or no credit for that task.\n\n5.10.5 Can I get more feedback?\nYes! We encourage you discuss your assessment first with the marker or course lead (regardless of what grade you received) and you can do so either by messaging the marker or course lead directly to arrange an appointment. You can also speak to the GTA team about your coding skills for further development. All staff contact details can be found on the University of Glasgow directory.\n\n5.10.6 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded. That said, even if you are unhappy with your grade, your first point of contact should be to arrange an additional feedback meeting with your marker for further discussion to help explain your feedback and grade. Following this, if you still have concerns you should consult the guidance from the SRC which provides a clear explanation of the University appeals procedures."

    "text": "7.13 Feedback information\n\n7.13.1 What type of feedback will I receive for this assessment?\nYou will receive feedback on your attainment of the overall marking criteria (Knowledge and Research, Critical Evaluation, Academic Communication) in terms of the verbal descriptors from Schedule A and feedforward comments as to how to develop your knowledge and skills for future assignments.\nAssessments are graded on the 22-point scale using the Schedule A marking criteria. There are three equally weighted Assessment Criteria (Knowledge and Research, Critical Evaluation, Academic Communication). You can find out more about Schedule A by downloading this PDF but the important thing to help you interpret your feedback is the use of the verbal descriptors, i.e., the words like “excellent” and “good” used to describe different grades. You should look out for these words to help you understand how you performed on each ILO.\n\n7.13.2 Can I get more feedback?\nYou are more than welcome to receive additional feedback after the marking process:\n\nIf you would like to discuss your feedback you should first contact the person that marked your assignment. However, we ask that you wait 24 hours after the release of the feedback before you do so to give you time to fully reflect on the feedback given.\nWhen meeting with the person who marked your assignment, you can discuss feedback and how it relates to your overall grade to help you improve in future assignments. However, do not be worried about attending to discuss how to maintain your standard if you have done better than you expected. You are more than welcome to come discuss any aspect of your feedback or the assignment in general.\nTo help any discussion about your feedback, we would ask that you complete the reflection form available on the Moodle page and send that to the person who marked your assignment as part of the discussion, when arranging a meeting.\n\n7.13.3 How will feedback from this assessment help me in the future?\nThe feedback on this assessment will help you in writing future research reports, such as the qualitative report in semester 2, your MSc dissertation, and in any future research work you conduct that requires academic writing and evidence-based evaluation.\n\n7.13.4 Who assessed my work?\nThe first marker for your report will be a member of the Research Methods 1 team within the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\nFollowing University’s policy, as part of the marking procedures, the assignment marking will be moderated. The moderator will be another member of the research methods team who will moderate a range of work from across the cohort to ensure that appropriate academic standards have been applied in marking the assignments and that they have been applied consistently across the cohort of students being assessed.\n\n7.13.5 Can I have my work regraded?\nFurther feedback meetings with the person who marked your assignment is purely about additional information to help you improve and is not about changing your grade or having your work regraded. That said, even if you are unhappy with your grade, your first point of contact should be to arrange an additional feedback meeting with your marker for further discussion to help explain your feedback and grade. Following this, if you still have concerns you should consult the guidance from the SRC which provides a clear explanation of the University appeals procedures."

However, a few labs will be dedicated to key milestones. In this first lab, you will see a little tour of RStudio to show what it looks like.\nThe end of the lab will then be dedicated to a group discussion on the pre-lab activity on which variable pairs you are most interested in and a general Q&A."

First, you might be interested in the relationship between two variables, such as whether an increase in one variable is associated with an increase in another variable. Second, you might be interested in whether two groups differ on a given outcome.\nFor relationships, if you are thinking about which sub-scales might be correlated with each other or related, you might ask such research questions as:\n\nIs there a relationship between help-seeking and test anxiety?\nIs there an association between intrinsic goal orientation and effort regulation?\n\nIf you are thinking about which sub-scales might show group differences, you might ask such research questions as:\n\nDo mature students have lower test anxiety than traditional students?\nDo postgraduate students have higher intrinsic motivation than undergraduate students?\n\nWe will go into more detail about how to create formal research questions and hypotheses in future weeks. Starting in week 2, we will show you how to find peer-reviewed evidence to build your understanding of the variables, identify a rationale, and develop your research question and hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou will have freedom to develop a research question in your group but since you are using secondary data, there are constraints.

In the lab this week, we will be covering two topics to help support your group work and start on the research project: finding and reading research, and starting the group work agreement.\nIn the first part, your lab lead will take you through strategies for finding, reading, and organising research. This applies to your group and individual report in RM1, but it is also a vital skill for every course you will complete. You will see tips such as identifying key words to use in search engines, stringing together multiple key words or phrases, and the kind of databases that may be useful. The pre-lab reading task this week outlines this in more detail, but your lab lead will be highlighting key features.\nYour lab lead will then introduce you to the general structure of the empirical psychology journal article. Reading an article sounds like an easy task, but research (e.g., Kershaw et al., 2018) consistently shows students struggle at first. Your pre-lab task is to read through a tutorial we created on the QALMRI method (Brosowsky et al., 2020) for questions to ask and information to identify as you work through articles. This might seem slow and formulaic at first, but you will get quicker as you get used to reading articles and identifying the key information.\nIn the second part for your group discussion, you will start on the group work agreement. You will be working with other students on the programme you almost certainly have never worked with before, so you will work on building a shared understanding for how you and your group will work together, how you will communicate, and how you will share the tasks that form your stage one group report. You will not finish this in the lab, it will just be a starting point for you to start working with your group.",

    "section": "\n12.1 Finding journal articles",
    "text": "12.1 Finding journal articles\n\n12.1.1 Identifying key words\nBefore you can read journal articles, you need to find them. The first step in a literature review is working out what your keywords will be. You will be looking in databases, so you need to select the appropriate terms to ensure your search results return the content you are looking for. It takes patience to identify and tweak the search terms that identify the content you are looking for. As a starting point, these might be your topic or variables.\nOnce you identify some useful articles, these can provide further inspiration and specificity. Many journal articles will give you a helping hand as the authors must provide several keywords relating to the article. For example, Figure 12.1 from Schroeder and Epley (2015) highlights the keywords that describe their article.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Keywords on the front page of Schroeder and Epley (2015).\n\n\n\nThe majority of articles will post keywords under the abstract. Here, we can see there are seven words or short phrases that summarise the content of the article. Sometimes they are not truly relevant to the topic (e.g., open data here), so you will need to skim a few articles to recognise recurring themes and potentially useful keywords.\n\n12.1.2 Search strategies\nOnce you have some keywords, your next step will be to try and find more articles. The two main data bases you will use are the University of Glasgow library and Google Scholar.\nYou can access the University of Glasgow library through your student portal. This is the database that the university uses to pay for access to journal articles and ebooks. Glasgow has a huge number of journals available, so this will be one of your best resources as you may be asked to pay for articles if you access journal websites directly, never pay for articles though, there is always a way to find them. Google Scholar is also a valuable resource that can return different results. A combination of these two databases will be a good starting point for any essay or report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNever pay for journal articles. We have a huge library at Glasgow, so you will almost always find the article by searching for the title. If it is not available, then there are other strategies like searching the title on Google Scholar or regular Google and there might be a PDF someone has posted. Authors can often freely share an author manuscript (also known as a post-print) which contains the same text as the final article but without the fancy journal formatting.\n\n\nEnter your keywords in the search bar of these data bases. You can enter one word or phrase and the data base will try to locate resources that contain that word. For example, we might want to find additional articles investigating job candidates’ speech (Figure 12.2).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Searching for articles using one keyword.\n\n\n\nHowever, it is usually much more powerful to combine search terms to provide more precise results. If you enter single words or phrases, you might find there are thousands of results which contain mostly irrelevant articles. You can use two or more keywords to look for more specific articles (Figure 12.3).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Searching for articles using multiple keywords.\n\n\n\nHere, you can see we have used speech AND decision making AND hiring. The capitalised AND is called a Boolean operator. It is used to link together the three words. It means we only want articles that contain the three words. Not one of them, not two of them, but all three. Using AND narrows down your search. Alternatively, you can use OR which expands your search to look for two or more terms. AND will provide fewer results and OR will provide more. You can also use NOT to rule out particular terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can do this in the single search bar by entering the Boolean operators yourself. Alternatively, if you click advanced search, you can add search boxes and choose from AND, OR, and NOT for each term. You can also start to filter your results to only return results from a date range, if you only wanted articles from say the past 5 years.\n\n\nYou can also use Boolean operators in Google Scholar to combine the search terms gender AND “hiring decisions”. This means we only want search results that contain both elements (Figure 12.4).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Using Boolean operators in Google Scholar.\n\n\n\nWe surround the phrase “Hiring decisions” with quotes. This forces databases to search for the specific phrase exactly as typed in the quotes. If we did not surround it by quotes, we can get search results that contain the words hiring and decisions separately or together. If they are separate, the results might not be quite what we are looking for.\nAs a final literature searching tip, once you find an article that is precisely on the topic you are searching for, you can look at articles in it’s reference list and at articles that have since cited it. This is no guarantee there will be something useful, but you can often benefit from the citation trees of your key articles.\nOn the library portal, you can see articles that your target articles cites, which will show the articles in its reference list that are readable by the library database (Figure 12.5).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Identifying articles that a target article cites in the library portal.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, on Google Scholar, you can look through the articles that have since cited your target article (Figure 12.6). You will get fewer hits for more recent articles as there has been less time for another article to be published, but its another useful strategy for identifying potentially useful articles.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: Identifying articles that have since cited your target article in Google Scholar.\n\n\n\nFor further tips, see the University of Glasgow library guide on how to search for articles and a brief video navigating around the library search function."

Although you could download each article and manually enter the citation and reference list entries, there are more efficient ways to provide you with more time in other areas of your report or essay writing. A reference manager will help to keep your research organised and it will do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to entering citations and creating the reference list.\nOur recommendation is Zotero which you can download for free at https://www.zotero.org/. There are alternatives (such as EndNote which the university endorses as approved software), but most of the psychology team prefer Zotero. Under preferences, make sure you select APA 7th edition to format the citations and references correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs third-party software which requires you to create an account, we recommend not using the same password as your university account.\n\n\nUsing Zotero, you can:\n\nInstall a plugin to save articles you find through your web browser.\nIf there is an open access version of the article PDF, Zotero will automatically save it.\nManually upload PDFs and Zotero will try to find the key metadata such as the title, volume number etc.\nCreate folders to keep your research organised into folders, such as one for each assignment.\nCreate shared folders to add and access the same articles with people you are working with.\nCopy citation and reference lists into your assignment.\nUse the Zotero plugin in Word or Google Docs to enter citations and automatically create a reference list.\nAdd notes and highlights to each article you read within Zotero.\nSync your library across devices, so you can download articles on your laptop, but read the articles on your phone or tablet.\n\nJust keep in mind, Zotero cannot always find all the information or it gets some of the details wrong. So, you may have to manually enter/edit the details for the citation/reference to be formatted correctly. This is why it is still important to learn the key details of APA formatting, but you are using your understanding more efficiently to spot mistakes rather than manually format each entry in your assignment.\nIf you like to follow along to a video, there are some helpful resources on YouTube to guide you through a lot of the basics:\n\nMcGill University has a playlist of a short tutorials.\nThere are also longer tutorials working through the features of Zotero.\n\nThe Zotero website also has a quick start guide if you prefer a written explanation in addition to detailed documentation."

    "text": "12.3 Reading journal articles\nNow you have one or two articles, the ability to read them might sound obvious, but research (e.g., Kershaw et al., 2018) consistently shows students find it difficult at first to summarise and critically evaluate empirical research. Our students have a range of backgrounds, so we want to make sure everyone has the skills to read and evaluate published research.\nJournal articles have a different structure and writing style than textbooks or news articles. Usually, they are not written to be a thrilling bedtime read. They can be quite dense with lots of technical jargon. This means - particularly early in your degree - you must be quite strategic in how you read journal articles.\nUntil you learn about different statistical tests, the introduction and discussion sections will be most accessible. The introduction provides the background to the study and outlines what the study is trying to achieve. The discussion recaps what results the authors think they found and puts them in context. As you progress through your research methods courses, you will understand more of the method and results.\n\n12.3.1 Types of Journal Article\nBefore we introduce the QALMRI method, it is important you recognise there are different types of journal article. The QALMRI method mainly applies to original quantitative research, so here is a list of common journal articles and types of research you may come across:\n\nOriginal research: quantitative studies: Potentially the most common type of research in psychology. These articles contain an individual study or a series of studies where the researchers collect numeric data to answer their research question. This is what we will focus on for this tutorial.\nOriginal research: qualitative studies: Some research follows a different methodological philosophy where they collect non-numerical data, such as identifying themes in forum posts. The QALMRI method would not totally apply here as qualitative research typically does not test hypotheses, but you would identify the authors’ broad and specific research questions and their important results.\nSystematic reviews and/or meta-analyses: Researchers may want to identify all the relevant articles on a topic and collate their findings. In a systematic review, the authors provide an overview of the findings in words. In a meta-analysis, the authors apply statistical techniques to calculate the average effect size across studies and how much the effect sizes vary.\nReview article: Instead of trying to identify all relevant articles in a systematic review, a review is less comprehensive. Researchers typically write review articles to explain a topic to readers or outline a theory.\nEditorials: Editors of a journal may write short introductions to a collection of articles they are publishing or announce a new policy for their journal.\nCommentary or opinion articles: Commentary or opinion articles allow authors to present their viewpoint on a topic, typically in response to another article. For example, if a set of authors disagree with the methods or interpretation of an original article, they can write a commentary or opinion article to explain why they disagree. ### The QALMRI Method\n\nOne evidenced-based strategy to learn how to read journal articles containing original quantitative research is known as the QALMRI (Question, Alternatives, Logic, Method, Results, and Inferences) method (Brosowsky et al., 2020). You can read more about the method on Crump’s (2018) Research Methods Lab Manual. When reading an article, try and answer the following questions:\nQuestions\n\nWhat was the broad question (the general topic of interest) being asked by this research project?\nWhat was the specific question (what this specific experiment will address) being asked by this research project?\n\nAlternatives\n\nWhat was the author’s hypothesis (the hypothesis they are testing)?\nWhat were the alternative hypotheses (what other explanations could there be that the authors ruled out)?\n\nLogic\n\nWhat was the logic of the hypothesis? i.e., if the hypothesis was true, what should we expect to happen?\n\nMethods\n\nBriefly describe the study design (i.e., experimental or correlational?) and sample.\nWhat were the variables? i.e., independent and dependent variables for experiments; variables for correlations.\nBriefly describe the study procedure in everyday terms.\n\nResults\n\nWhat were the important results?\n\nInferences\n\nWhat did the authors conclude from their study?\nHow did the authors use the results to make inferences and conclusions about the hypothesis and research question?\n\n12.3.2 The QALMRI Method in Action\nThe authors of the QALMRI method (Brosowsky & Parshina, 2017) provide a worked example so you can see what information you must identify in a journal article. The following answers are reproduced from Brosowsky and Parshina with some minor edits. They evaluated the study “Ecological validity of the testing effect: The use of daily quizzes in introductory Psychology” by Batsell et al. (2017):\n\n12.3.2.1 Questions\n\nWhat was the broad question (the general topic of interest) being asked by this research project?\n\nWhat kinds of teaching techniques will improve student learning in a classroom?\n\nWhat was the specific question (what this specific experiment will address) being asked by this research project?\n\nWill daily quizzes enhance retention of assigned study material?\n\n12.3.2.2 Alternatives\n\nWhat was the author’s hypothesis (the hypothesis they are testing)?\n\nHypothesis 1: Daily quizzes will improve memory for study material whether the material had appeared in a quiz or not.\n\nWhat were the alternative hypotheses (what other explanations could there be that the authors ruled out)?\n\nHypothesis 2: Daily quizzes will only improve memory for study material that appeared in the quizzes.\nHypothesis 3: Daily quizzes will not improve memory for study material.\n\n12.3.2.3 Logic\n\nWhat was the logic of the hypothesis? i.e., if the hypothesis was true, what should we expect to happen?\n\nIf hypothesis 1, then a quizzed group will perform better than a study-only group on a memory test for all the studied material.\nIf hypothesis 2, then a quizzed group will perform better than a study-only group on a memory test, but only for the material that appeared on the tests.\nIf hypothesis 3, then a quizzed group will not perform better than a study-only group on a memory test for the studied material. Note: In essence, this is the null hypothesis of no difference.\n\n12.3.2.4 Methods\n\nBriefly describe the study design (i.e., experimental or correlational?) and sample.\n\nThe study used a 2x3 factorial design (quasi-experimental). The sample included 64 university students from a range of levels in the authors’ department.\n\nWhat were the variables? i.e., independent and dependent variables for experiments; variables for correlations.\n\nIndependent Variable A: Class (study-only and quiz): - One class received daily quizzes while the other did not.\n\nThis variable is between-subjects and quasi-experimental (students were not randomly assigned to classes).\n\nIndependent Variable B: Question-Type (identical, similar, and new):\n\nMemory test questions were either identical to those used in the quizzes (identical), similar in content to those used in the quizzes (similar), or did not appear in the quizzes (new).\nThis variable is within-subjects and experimental (questions were randomly assigned to each condition).\n\nDependent Variable: Accuracy averaged across three memory tests.\n\nBriefly describe the study procedure in everyday terms.\n\nStudents enrolled in two Introduction to Psychology courses took part in the study. The participants were all assigned textbook readings which consisted of material not taught during the lectures. One class received daily quizzes (21 total), while the other did not. Memory was tested three times throughout the term using 15 multiple-choice questions. Test questions were either identical to the quiz questions (identical), similar in content to the quiz questions (similar), or questions that did not appear in the quizzes (new).\n\n12.3.2.5 Results\n\nWhat were the important results?\n\nThe Class x Question-Type ANOVA and follow-up t-tests show that the quiz group outperformed the study-only group on all three question types. However, this difference was greatest for identical questions (21.8%), then similar questions (17.6%), and smallest for new questions (12.7%).\nANOVAs with follow-up t-tests were also run separately on the quiz and study-only groups. The results for the study group showed no significant differences in performance across the identical (58.4%), similar (62.8%), and new (60.4%) question types. The results for the quiz group however, showed that performance for the identical (80.2%) and similar (80.4%) questions was significantly better than performance for the new questions (73.1%).\n\n12.3.2.6 Inferences\n\nWhat did the authors conclude from their study?\n\nThe results of the experiment show enhanced retention of studied material when participants were quizzed daily regardless of whether the study material was actually presented during the quizzes or not.\nThe authors conclude that they successfully replicated the testing effect, previously shown in laboratory settings, in a naturalistic classroom setting. Furthermore, they conclude that the testing benefit generalizes to non-quizzed material and therefore instructors do not need to quiz all of the study material to gain the testing effect benefit.\n\nHow did the authors use the results to make inferences and conclusions about the hypothesis and research question?\n\nThese results are consistent with the original hypothesis (Hypothesis 1) and suggest that periodic quizzes can enhance the retention of assigned material (specific question) and testing could be used as an effective teaching technique to improve student learning in a classroom setting (big question).\n\n12.3.3 Exercise: Applying the QALMRI Method\nNow you have read about the QALMRI method and saw how you can answer the 11 questions based on the information in a journal article, it is time to practice yourself on a new article.\nPieger et al. (2018) is available open access through the journal Frontiers in Education. They studied the disfluency effect: the idea that writing information in a harder to read font requires greater concentration which can lead to improved recall when quizzed on the topic. Read through the article and try to answer the questions from the QALMRI method. The activity below is based on downloading the article as a PDF to see page numbers, but you could check your understanding of the QALMRI questions using either the web or PDF version.\nEach question has two elements: the page number that includes the information and a hidden solution providing a longer explanation. Make sure you attempt each question on your own first and then check you identified the correct information by looking at the solution.\n\n12.3.3.1 Questions\n\nWhat was the broad question (the general topic of interest) being asked by this research project?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the middle left of page 2, their broad question can best be described as “is disfluency a desirable difficulty and does it activate analytic monitoring?”.\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the specific question (what this specific experiment will address) being asked by this research project? There are two research questions the authors are interested in here, but they are both on the same page.\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bottom right of page 3, their specific research questions are helpfully in the research questions sub-section. They are asking two questions: (1) does viewing disfluent then fluent test activiate analytic monitoring and (2) does viewing fluent then disfluent text activate surface level monitoring?\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3.2 Alternatives\n\nWhat was the author’s hypothesis (the hypothesis they are testing)?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bottom right of page 3, hypothesis 1: when participants view disfluent then fluent texts, they expect no difference between disfluent text and fluent text on their outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nWhat were the alternative hypotheses (what other explanations could there be that the authors ruled out)?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bottom right of page 3, hypothesis 2: when participants view fluent then disfluent texts, they expect the outcomes such as ease of learning to be lower for disfluent text than fluent text. Note: This is slightly different to the previous example. Pieger et al. (2018) did not outline competing hypotheses, they just outlined their predictions in two parts for each presentation order.\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3.3 Logic\n\nWhat was the logic of the hypothesis? i.e., if the hypothesis was true, what should we expect to happen? There is no page number to identify here, you just need outline what results would support each hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor hypothesis 1, there will be no difference in the dependent variables between disfluent text and fluent text when participants are shown the materials in the disfluent then fluent order.\nFor hypothesis 2, the dependent variables will be lower for disfluent text than fluent text when participants are shown the materials in the fluent then disfluent order.\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3.4 Methods\n\nBriefly describe the study design (i.e., experimental or correlational?) and sample.\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the left middle of page 4, the study is a 2x2 mixed design. Note: the authors do not specifically outline the design in shorthand, but they describe each independent variable. The sample included 65 university students from the authors’ department.\n\n\n\n\nWhat were the variables? i.e., independent and dependent variables for experiments; variables for correlations.\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIV1 is between-subjects and includes the contrast group for which order they see the text. IV2 is within-subjects and includes both fluent and disfluent text conditions. The study has several dependent variables including ease of learning, prediction of performance, and actual memory performance.\n\n\n\n\nBriefly describe the study procedure in everyday terms.\n\nPages  and  best include this information. There is also a diagram to help explain the procedure on page .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each fluent and disfluent text, participants briefly saw the text and completed the dependent variables related to the first monitoring judgments. For example, rating how confident they were about their performance. Then the participants studied the text for up to 15 minutes and completed the second monitoring judgments. Depending on IV1, they either read the disfluent text first or the fluent text first. When they finished reading both texts, they completed knowledge tests for both texts at the end.\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3.5 Results\n\nWhat were the important results? There are several pages of results to cover each dependent variable, so for the purposes of this exercise, focus on the performance results. Did participants recall more information about the fluent or disfluent text?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bottom left of page 7, performance is the last dependent variable they analyse before summarising all their results. There was a statistically significant main effect of fluency. This means if you ignore which contrast group they were allocated to, performance was higher for fluent text than disfluent text. Note: the authors also use something called Bayesian statistics which we do not cover in this course.\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3.6 Inferences\n\nWhat did the authors conclude from their study?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the top and middle of page 7, the authors recap their results at the start of the discussion. When the fluent text was presented first, participants use fluency as a cue for all learning judgements (e.g., ease of learning and prediction of performance). Participants rated these variables as lower for the disfluent text than for the fluent text. However, when the disfluent text was presented first, participants no longer use fluency as a cue for learning judgments and there was no significant difference between fluent and disfluent texts.\n\n\n\n\nHow did the authors use the results to make inferences and conclusions about the hypothesis and research question?\n\nPage  best includes this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the top and middle of page 7, the authors concluded their results support both hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 1 predicted there would be no difference in learning judgments when participants read the disfluent then the fluent text. Hypothesis 2 predicted learning judgments would be lower for the disfluent text when participants read the fluent then the disfluent text.\n\n\n\n\n12.3.4 Organising journal articles\nThe QALMRI method applies to individual journal articles, but in your assignments, we expect you to read several articles to build a literature review. You can take the QALMRI method and create a table using something like Word or Excel to collate the articles you read. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nQuestion\nAlternative\nLogic\nMethods\nResults\nInference\n\n\n\nBatsell et al. (2016)\n1. What kinds of teaching techniques will…\n3. Hypothesis 1: Daily quizzes will improve memory…\n5. If hypothesis 1, then a quizzed group will…\n6. The study used a 2x3 factorial design…\n9. The Class x Question-Type ANOVA…\n10. The results of the experiment show…\n\n\nPieger et al. (2018)\n1. Is disfluency a desirable difficulty…\n3. Hypothesis 1: When participants view disfluent…\n5. For hypothesis 1, there will be no difference…\n6. The study is a 2x2 mixed design…\n9. There was a statistically significant main effect of fluency…\n10. When the fluent text was presented first…\n\n\n\n\n\nEach row can be one article you read and you can group each section of the QALMRI method as separate columns. As you build your literature review, you can see similarities and differences across the studies. You also have prompts for critical evaluation where you can comment on features like the sample and sample size. Organising your notes like this will help you stay organised as its unlikely you will remember every key feature of the 10th or 20th article.\nIn addition, you might find these blog posts by Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega - a political scientist - helpful when thinking about how you can approach a literature review and keep your reading organised:\n\nHow to undertake a literature review: This post talks about how you can approach searching for literature in a new area or in your case, a new assignment.\nSynthesizing different bodies of work in your literature review: This post demonstrates Raul’s approach to recording the results of a literature review. You might find it helpful for structuring your own approach. Just keep in mind as a political scientist, there is a lot of emphasis on quotes which we do not tend to use in psychology.\n\n12.3.5 Summary and Additional Resources\nLike any skill, learning how to recognise the key information in journal articles takes time and practice. Journal articles are typically written for expert audiences, so they may not specifically label key information you are looking for. For example, in the exercise above, Pieger et al. did not say they used a 2x2 mixed design. You had to recognise the information in the main text and piece it together. As you read more journal articles, you will get quicker at recognising this information, allowing you to focus more time on reading the article critically than simply understanding it.\nIf you would like additional tips and resources on reading journal articles, you might find the following articles useful:\n\nThis short blog by Raff (2016) aims to explain journal articles to non-scientists, so it should provide an accessible introduction.\nThis short article by Pain (2016) has quotes from several high-profile researchers where they explain how they approach reading a scientific paper.\nThis long article by Carey et al. (2020) discusses how to approach reading a journal article for different purposes by presenting 10 rules to follow."

In the lab this week, we will be covering two topics to help support your group work and start on the research project: finding and reading research, and starting the group work agreement.\nIn the first part, your lab lead will take you through strategies for finding, reading, and organising research. This applies to your group and individual report in RM1, but it is also a vital skill for every course you will complete. You will see tips such as identifying key words to use in search engines, stringing together multiple key words or phrases, and the kind of databases that may be useful. The pre-lab reading task this week outlines this in more detail, but your lab lead will be highlighting key features.\nYour lab lead will then introduce you to the general structure of the empirical psychology journal article. Reading an article sounds like an easy task, but research (e.g., Kershaw et al., 2018) consistently shows students struggle at first. Your pre-lab task is to read through a tutorial we created on the QALMRI method (Brosowsky et al., 2020) for questions to ask and information to identify as you work through articles. This might seem slow and formulaic at first, but you will get quicker as you get used to reading articles and identifying the key information.\nIn the second part for your group discussion, you will start on the group work agreement. You will be working with other students on the programme you almost certainly have never worked with before, so you will work on building a shared understanding for how you and your group will work together, how you will communicate, and how you will share the tasks that form your stage one group report. You will not finish this in the lab, it will just be a starting point for you to start working with your group."

    "title": "13  Introductions and Identifying the Rationale",
    "section": "\n13.1 The introduction",
    "text": "13.1 The introduction\nThe introduction provides the background to your study for what influenced your work. Relating back to the hypothetico-deductive model, the introduction focuses on the cycle between previous research and identifying your research question. You need to know what research and theory already exists before you can identify an opportunity for your own work. There are four key components:\n\nIntroduction to the general topic and research question.\nEvaluation of relevant research and theory.\nEstablish a rationale for the current study.\nPresent the research question and hypothesis (where applicable).\n\nThe introduction is the top of the hourglass shape of a report, starting broad and becoming more specific as you get closer to the end (Figure 13.2). You do not typically have sub-headings to present these components as specific sub-sections or dedicate just one paragraph to each part, rather they are key concepts to cover as you move through the introduction.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: The introduction highlighted as the focus of this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n13.1.1 Introduction to the general topic and research question\nThe opening paragraph or two to the introduction is the broadest section. We are at the top of the hourglass and this is where you introduce your reader to the key concepts. You are trying to provide the rationale behind your overall topic, so you might include statistics to highlight the extend of a given problem. You might also present definitions for key concepts to make it clear to your reader what you are researching. This part of the introduction is all about setting the scene to your reader and establishing why it is a topic worth addressing.\n\n13.1.2 Evaluation of relevant research and theory\nThe literature review should provide a critical and focused exploration of your topic area. You do not need to try and summarise all the research that has ever been done on your topic, you are trying to identify what is most relevant and up-to-date.\nCritical evaluation is an important skill that takes time to develop. Instead of just listing and describing the studies in your literature review, you must add narrative and identify gaps in current knowledge. Try and ask yourself as you are documenting the studies you find:\n\nAre the findings consistent across studies, or do they provide a more complicated mixed picture?\nAll studies are not created equally, each will have their own strength and weaknesses. You do not need to walk through the strengths and limitations of each study, but you will make an assessment on how reliable you consider the evidence base to be.\nIs there a relevant theory or framework that explains the observations of previous research? Do the studies support this theory or suggest there are limitations?\n\n13.1.3 Establish a rationale for the current study\nBy the end of the introduction, you are trying to clearly communicate what opportunity you have identified in past research and present your argument for why it is important to address that opportunity. This is the rationale as the reasoning behind why your study is necessary. Sometimes the opportunity is to explore something new, other times you could identify limitations in past research that need addressing. There is not one single valid approach to the rationale, it all depends on the strength of your argument you presented throughout the introduction.\nTo show the range of possibilities for the strategy behind your rationale, we wrote a specific section and activities on identifying the rationale below.\n\n13.1.4 Present the research question and hypothesis\nThe final part of your introduction should be a summary of what you want to find out in your study (your research question) and what you predict you will find based on previous research (your hypothesis). The most effective introductions will present a clear narrative from the start to the end, so the reader can almost guess what your rationale, research question, and hypothesis is before you tell them.\nDepending on the aim of your study, remember a research question is essential, but a hypothesis is not. If your study is exploratory, there might not be enough research to make a prediction, so the aim of your study is gather evidence. If you study is confirmatory, there will be a larger research base and the aim of your study is to test a specific prediction.\n\n13.1.4.1 Research questions\nResearch Questions (RQs) are broad overarching questions of interest. They are posed literally as questions and summarise what you hope to answer through your study. Research questions should be:\n\nClear: specific enough to be understood without further explanation.\nFocused: narrow enough that you can answer it with your project.\nComplex: there is enough discussion to create a report out of it.\nConcise: to the point so it is more likely to be understood.\nArguable: there is not already a clearly accepted answer and there is a rationale for your project, regardless of whether it is more of a novel approach or it is a direct replication of one specific study.\n\nIt is crucial to base your research question on previous research. Make sure you have read enough to pose your research question as you need to know what is already out there before you can present the rationale for your study.\nAn example of a poor research question could be: Do undergraduate students suffer from text anxiety? It is quite vague and the context is unclear for what is being compared and how. A better research question could be: Do undergraduate students self-report greater test anxiety than postgraduate students? This is more focused on the actual research at hand, showing who you are comparing and giving more detail on what you want to measure.\n\n13.1.4.2 Hypotheses\nHypotheses are specific statements making a prediction for what you will find. Hypotheses should be:\n\nClear: you can easily understand the statement.\nSpecific: you cover all the key information, such as who, what, and how.\nFalsifiable: you should be able test the prediction to show how evidence either supports or refutes it.\nOperationalised: to state how you are measuring your constructs.\n\nTo break down these features, we can start with a good example of: We hypothesise that there will be a positive correlation between effort regulation scores and help-seeking scores in mature students, as measured through the MSLQ. We can then manipulate different features for emphasis:\n\nMissing operationalisation: We hypothesise that there will be a positive correlation between effort regulation scores and help-seeking scores in mature students.\nNot testable: We hypothesise that there might be a positive correlation between effort regulation scores and help-seeking scores in mature students.\nNot a hypothesis: Is there a positive correlation between effort regulation and help-seeking?\n\nDepending on how much previous literature is out there and how convinced you are by it, you can pose a directional or non-directional hypothesis. A directional hypothesis makes a prediction in a specific direction, for instance group A will be faster than group B. On the other hand, a non-directional hypothesis predicts there will be an effect, but it is not clear what direction it will be. For example, the speed of group A will be different to the speed of group B.\nYou might pose a non-directional hypothesis for exploratory research to help your focus. For confirmatory research, you should be able to specify a clear directional prediction to test.\n\n13.1.4.3 How does this relate to your stage one group report?\nFor your stage one group report, you will be focusing on either the relationship between two variables or comparing the difference in one outcome between two groups. Depending on which approach you and your group are taking, the terminology you use for the research question and hypothesis will differ.\nCorrelations assess whether there is a relationship between two variables. You might have a non-directional prediction where you think two variables are correlated, but you are not sure how. Alternatively, you might have a directional prediction where you expect a certain correlation direction. Positive correlations are where if one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase. Negative correlations are where if one variable increases, the other variables tends to decrease. If some of the terminology is unfamiliar to you at this point, we do not cover correlations and continuous predictors until week 7 after reading week.\nIn contrast, comparing groups assesses whether there is a difference between two groups on your outcome. If you have a non-directional hypothesis, you think there might be a difference between the two groups, but you are not sure which direction. If you have a directional hypothesis, you expect one group to score higher than the other group. You will learn about t-tests and categorical predictors for the analysis techniques suited to this kind of research question in week 8."

    "title": "13  Introductions and Identifying the Rationale",
    "section": "\n13.2 Identifying the rationale",
    "text": "13.2 Identifying the rationale\nNow we have introduced the key components of an introduction, we want to spend a little more time on different strategies for the rationale. As much as we would love to just tinker as scientists, each study tries to address some kind of problem the authors have identified in previous research. These are often small tweaks. Keep the phrase “standing on the shoulders of giants” in mind as science typically advances through minor changes rather than completely revolutionary ways of studying a topic. Approaches for the rationale will differ by discipline and sub-discipline but there are some common strategies you can look out for.\nIn this section, we have provided seven examples of the rationale from different empirical psychology articles, including exploration, replications, testing competing theories, applying the methods from one study to a new sample/population or topic, and addressing limitations in past research. The rationale should be built as a thread running throughout the introduction as you narrow down to what your study focuses on, but we have isolated paragraphs that specifically comment on the opportunity they have identified. For each example, we have explained the general approach, provided an extract, and described in our own words the authors’ line of argument.\nAt the end, we have some activities to test if you can recognise different strategies. By the end of this resource, you will be able to identify different strategies behind the rationale in published research and hopefully clearly communicate the rationale in your own reports.\n\n13.2.1 Exploring an under researched topic\nAlthough completely novel research is rare, there are times when there is little knowledge about a population or topic. For example, there might be a change in practice or a cultural phenomenon that means you have little prior research to turn to. This means your study would follow more of an exploratory approach to gather information and learn about a new population or topic.\nExample: Beaudry et al. (2022, pg. 2) were interested in what incoming undergraduate students knew about open science practices. Moving out of the replication crisis, increasing numbers of researchers adopted open science practices and more journals were encouraging or enforcing them. As this was a rapid shift in how researchers conducted studies, Beaudry et al. explored undergraduate students’ beliefs about open science practices as they had little prior research for this cultural shift.\n\n“…An understanding of contemporary methodological practices—and problematic methodological practices—is essential for becoming informed and critical consumers of psychological knowledge. Studies have explored strategies for educating psychology students about replicability and open science practices (e.g., Chopik et al., 2018; Grahe et al., 2012; Jekel et al., 2020). These initiatives may help ingrain open science norms and change attitudes about research practices, but we know little about what students know or believe about open science research practices prior to entering the university classroom. This knowledge could be useful for two main reasons… [two paragraph gap]\n\n\nTo examine this, we conducted a descriptive study, asking incoming students in undergraduate psychology courses about their beliefs regarding reproducibility and open science practices. Our survey encompassed questions concerning norms (how students felt research should be conducted), norms in practice (how students believe psychological research is conducted), and replicability (how replicable students believe psychological research is). Our study was exploratory (see Wagenmakers et al., 2012) and descriptive; as such, we did not specify or test hypotheses.”\n\n\n13.2.2 Direct replication of a previous study\nAuthors can argue it is important to verify the results of a specific previous study. This means they would use the exact same method as the target study but in a new sample to find out if you can get the same results. The rationale for a direct replication often explains why it is important to replicate individual studies in general or why the target study should be replicated. For different features of a study you might highlight to motivate a direct replication, Alister et al. (2021) polled researchers on features that would increase or decrease their confidence in replicating the study’s results.\nExample: Micallef and Newton (2022, pg. 2) investigate the use of concrete examples in learning abstract concepts. Their article is a direct replication of a specific study they highlight. They explain Rawson et al. is an influential study but other research questions the consistency of the findings, so they want to replicate their method as closely as possible to see if they get the same results.\n\n“Thus, the evidence base for the use of concrete examples in teaching would appear to be mixed. Given the potential significance of Rawson et al. for the teaching of psychology, but set against some mixed findings from other studies, we tested the replicability of the key finding from Rawson et al. Rawson gave their participants definitions of some abstract ideas from psychology, followed by multiple different concrete examples of those ideas. A control group received only the definitions, repeatedly. Both groups were then tested to determine whether they could match examples to definitions. The group which had received the concrete examples were better able to match definitions to examples including, critically, examples that they had not previously seen. Rawson et al. suggested their study was amongst the first study of its kind to use a ‘no-example’ control group, a design which considerably strengthened the conclusions but highlighted the paucity of well-controlled research into the application of this idea to learning and teaching, and further emphasised the need for replication of the findings from this key study.”\n\n\n13.2.3 Conceptual replication of a previous study\nWhereas a direct replication wants to copy the method of a study as closely as possible, a conceptual replication tries to test the same idea or hypothesis using different methods (Nosek & Errington, 2017). The aim is to find out if you can make similar conclusions under different methods and increase your confidence in an explanation or theory of human behaviour.\nKeep in mind there is a continuum between a direct and conceptual replication. It comes down to judgement and subject expertise on what differences would turn a direct replication into a conceptual replication. For instance, Lebel et al. (2018) present a replication recipe where authors rate their methods as exact, close, or different on features including measures, procedure, and location.\nExample: Ekuni et al. (2020, pg. 5) wanted to learn about study strategies in a different population. They highlighted previous studies focused on US American samples which tend to be relatively higher in education level and socioeconomic status than some other countries. Therefore, they took the method of Karpicke et al. (2009) - a US-based study - and applied it to a sample in Brazil to investigate if they could find a similar pattern of results.\n\n“This is even more important in countries in which educational outcomes are poorer than those in the U.S. and in which the need for interventions that can help improve academic success and reduce educational inequities is dire (see UNESCO, 2015; Master, Meltzoff, & Lent, 2016), such as Brazil. To do so, it is necessary to carry out a conceptual replication on preference of study techniques in more diverse non-WEIRD contexts to analyze whether culture of origin, SES, and sex can influence students’ study strategies, because designing adequate interventions may have to consider tailoring to fit particular characteristics of different types of students.”\n\n\n13.2.4 Testing competing theories or conflicting research\nAs you research a given area, you recognise patterns across the findings of articles. Imagine you are studying the effectiveness of an intervention treatment compared to a control treatment. Do all the studies show the intervention works, do most studies show the intervention works, or is there completely mixed evidence on whether the intervention performs better than the control? If there are conflicting findings, then the aim of your study could be to add more evidence.\nRelatedly, there might be competing theories on the same phenomenon. One theory might expect participants to score higher in one condition compared to another, while another theory expects participants to score higher in the other condition. This means the aim of your study could be to find out which theory is best supported.\nExample: Bartlett et al. (2022, pg. 2) combined both components after observing some studies showed daily smokers’ attention would gravitate towards smoking images more than non-daily smokers, whereas other studies showed the opposite pattern. There were theories which could support each observation, so Bartlett et al. aimed to test which theory and pattern of results would receive the most support.\n\n“…Collectively, these studies show that smokers consistently display greater attentional bias towards smoking cues than non-smokers, but it is not clear whether lighter or heavier smokers show greater attentional bias.\n\n\nTo address this inconsistency, the current study focused on comparing attentional bias towards smoking cues in daily and non-daily smokers. While most studies use the visual probe task to measure attentional bias, their relatively small sample sizes and inconsistent research design features complicate drawing conclusions from the mixed findings. Therefore, we used a much larger sample size than previous studies and manipulated different features of the visual probe task.”\n\n\n13.2.5 Applying the methods of one study to a new sample/population\nIt is important to consider whether your planned measures and/or manipulations are valid and reliable. This means you could identify components of the method you consider robust in previous research, but you apply them to a new sample or population that would let you address your research question.\nThis is similar to the argument in the conceptual replication example, but there is a subtle difference in the aims of the approach. In a conceptual replication, you want to know whether you can find similar results using different methods. The emphasis is on comparing your findings to a target study to see if they are similar or different. On the other hand, in this approach, you want to learn something new by applying methods from one study to a new sample. The emphasis is on addressing a new research question using methods that have a precedent in past research.\nExample: Veldkamp et al. (2017, pg. 128/129) investigated the storybook image of scientists in scientists themselves. In their introduction, they outlined studies on the general public’s perception of scientists’ characteristics like honesty and objectivity. However, the authors explained they were unaware of similar research of scientists’ perception of scientists’ characteristics. This means they were applying methods to a new sample that was previously under researched.\n\n“…More recently, European and American surveys have demonstrated that lay people have a stable and strong confidence both in science (Gauchat 2012; Smith and Son 2013) and in scientists (Ipsos MORI 2014; Smith and Son 2013). For example, the scientific community was found to be the second most trusted institution in the United States (Smith and Son 2013), and in the United Kingdom, the general public believed that scientists meet the expectations of honesty, ethical behavior, and open-mindedness (Ipsos MORI 2014).\n\n\nAs far as we know, no empirical work has addressed scientists’ views of the scientist. Although preliminary results from Robert Pennock’s “Scientific Virtues Project” (cited in “Character traits: Scientific virtue,” 2016) indicate that scientists consider honesty, curiosity, perseverance, and objectivity to be the most important virtues of a scientist, these results do not reveal whether scientists believe that the typical scientist actually exhibits these virtues…”\n\n\n13.2.6 Applying the methods of one study to a new topic\nRelated to the previous strategy, you might not have a new sample/population you want to learn about, but you might want to apply the methods of a past study to a new topic. For instance, your research question might focus on alcohol but previous studies you are aware of might have used smoking images. The emphasis in this strategy is that you want to learn something new by applying the methods of one study to a different topic.\nExample: Irving et al. (2022, pg. 2) studied the effect of correcting statistical misinformation. Making causal claims about correlations is a common mistake in science journalism when you lose some of the nuance of full journal articles and the authors wanted to know if you could correct that statistical misinformation. Previous studies had corrected other types of misinformation using this technique, but Irving et al. wanted to know whether it would be effective in reducing statistical misinformation. This means they applied the method from one study to a new topic it had not been used on before.\n\n“In this study, we applied the continued influence paradigm, which has traditionally been used to examine general misinformation, to a novel context. We investigated whether it is possible to correct a common form of statistical misinformation present in popular media: inappropriately drawing causal conclusions from correlational evidence. Participants were randomized to one of two experimental conditions: no-correction or correction. They read a fictional news story about the relationship between extended TV watching and cognitive decline, inspired by an article in The New York Times (Bakalar, 2019). Informed by previous research, we designed the correction to be as powerful as possible. We therefore included an alternative explanation, in recognition of the fact that individuals prefer to maintain a complete but incorrect model of an event until they are given an alternative explanation to sufficiently fill the gap left by a simple negation (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). Similarly, we ensured that the correction was from a credible source, that it maintained coherence with the story, and explained why the misinformation was inaccurate (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). The primary, confirmatory hypotheses were that participants in the correction condition would make fewer causal inferences (i.e., rely on the misinformation) and more correlational inferences (i.e., rely on the correction) than those in the no-correction condition, in response to the coded inference questions.”\n\n\n13.2.7 Addressing limitations in the method of a previous study\nEvery study has its strengths and weaknesses, the important thing is being able to justify your choices and acknowledge the limitations. One set of researchers might value a tightly controlled environment at the expense of a more realistic but messier environment, whereas you value a more realistic environment. In this strategy, your research question aims to learn something new by designing a study that addresses the limitations you identify in a past study.\nExample: Bostyn et al. (2018, page 2) were interested in the classic trolley dilemma where participants have the option of letting a tram run over five people or intervene and divert the tram so it runs over one person. Often, this is only a hypothetical dilemma, so the authors wanted to create a more realistic version. Instead of choosing to divert a tram, participants were faced with the option of shocking a cage of five mice or intervening and shocking a cage containing one mouse (the participants were unaware the mice would not actually be shocked). This means the authors wanted to investigate if participants would behave similarly in a more ecological valid task.\n\n“Until recently, this judgment–behavior discrepancy has been an academic concern plaguing only moral psychologists. However, trolley-dilemma-like situations are becoming increasingly relevant to model the moral decisions of artificial intelligence, such as self-driving autonomous vehicles (Bonnefon, Shariff, & Rahwan, 2016). Accordingly, whether or not hypothetical moral judgment is related to real-life behavior is prone to become a matter of public interest. We are aware of one study that has directly compared hypothetical moral judgment with real-life behavior: FeldmanHall et al. (2012) found that people are more willing to harm others for monetary profit in a real-life scenario than they are in a hypothetical version of the same scenario, thus confirming that real-life behavior can differ dramatically from hypothetical judgment. The current research was a first attempt to study this difference in the trolley-dilemma context through the admission of a”real-life” dilemma that required participants to make a trolley-dilemma-like decision between either allowing a very painful electroshock to be administered to five mice or choosing to deliver the entire shock to a single mouse.”\n\n\n13.2.8 Summary\nSo far, we have outlined the strategies behind the rationale from a selection of empirical psychology articles. This is not an exhaustive list, but we wanted to demonstrate the common lines of argument researchers take when explaining what opportunity they identified in past research and how their studies will address that opportunity.\nIt will be rare for studies to neatly fit into just one strategy. They might focus on one component or it might be a combination. Bostyn et al. (2018) addressed limitations in past research but you could also argue it was a conceptual replication by using a more ecologically valid task to see if they could observe similar findings to studies using hypothetical tasks. Likewise, Bartlett et al. (2022) tested competing theories, but also wanted to address limitations in the method of past studies.\nThe important lesson to take away from this is to clearly communicate your line of argument behind the rationale of your study. By the end of your introduction, it should be clear what opportunity you identified in previous research and why it is important for you to address that opportunity with your study.\n\n13.2.9 Activities\nNow that you have read about different strategies for a rationale and explored different examples, it is time to see if you can recognise key features of these strategies yourself. Remember, these are broad descriptions to capture the main features and there are many ways of presenting your argument for the rationale.\n\n13.2.9.1 Independent judgement 1: Muir et al. (2020)\nIn the following extract, Muir et al. (2020) explain their study on promoting classroom engagement through the use of an online student response system.\nAs you read through the extract, consider and select which strategy you think best fits their rationale. After selecting the type of rationale you think best fits, check the explain the answer box to see why we placed it there.\n\n“The use of Socrative has been investigated across a variety of disciplines including physics (Coca and Slisko 2013), physiology (Rae and O’Malley 2017), science (Wash 2014), sports management (Dervan 2014), computing (Awedh et al. 2014), English language (Kaya and Balta 2016), economics (Piatek 2014), and engineering (Dabbour 2016). Statistics courses are another area that may benefit from using Socrative given its potential positive effect on the student learning experience and considering that course evaluations by students taking statistics units tend to indicate poor engagement (Gladys, Nicholas, and Crispen 2012). To the authors’ knowledge, only one study has previously investigated the effect of Socrative specifically for statistics students. Balta and Guvercin (2016) found that the final grades of students enrolled in a statistics class who chose to engage with Socrative-based learning materials prior to their exam were significantly higher than the grades achieved by students who chose not to engage with the Socrative-based learning materials. Although this result is encouraging, the use of a non-randomized, post-test design means that we cannot confirm from this study that there is a beneficial effect for using Socrative, or if the difference in exam scores was due to underlying scholastic aptitude or motivation of the students who chose to engage with the OSRS. Hence, there is a need for further research exploring the use of Socrative specifically within statistics classrooms”\n\n\nWhat is the most fitting type of rationale?\n\nExploring an under researched topic.Direct replication of a previous study.Conceptual replication of a previous study.Addressing limitations in the method of a previous study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, the authors highlight there is one key article that studied a previous topic but they identified several flaws in the method that affect the conclusions. The earlier study by Balta and Guvercin (2016) uses a non-randomised post-test design which is prone to confounds and you cannot make a strong causal conclusion. In the next paragraph not shown here, the authors explain their study will target these limitations by randomising participants into conditions.\n\n\n\n\n13.2.9.2 Independent judgement 2: Harms et al. (2018)\nIn the following extract, Harms et al. (2018, pg. 2) explain their study on the rounded price effect.\nAs you read through the extract, consider and select which strategy you think best fits their rationale. After selecting the type of rationale you think best fits, check the explain the answer box to see why we placed it there.\n\n“In recent years, studies from nearly all subfields of psychology have been under increased scrutiny in the context of the ‘replication crisis’ [2-5]: as several studies suggest, we cannot take reported effects in the scientific literature at face value. As the findings by Wadhwa and Zhang have practical relevance to marketers, independent replication of the effect and a reasonable estimation of its size are desirable. From the theoretical outline of the effect one can expect the effect to be contingent on various factors. As a first step towards a better understanding of these external influences on the effect, a close replication under the same or at least very similar conditions as in the original study is warranted.”\n\n\nWhat is the most fitting type of rationale?\n\nExploring an under researched topic.Direct replication of a previous study.Conceptual replication of a previous study.Addressing limitations in the method of a previous study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, this was quite an obvious one. The authors mention a few times they want to replicate the rounded price effect that was first observed in Wadhwa and Zhang. They justify the direct replication by explaining it has practical implications to marketers and want to repeat the study as close as possible to the original methods.\n\n\n\n\n13.2.9.3 Independent judgement 3: Rode and Ringel (2019)\nIn the following extract, Rode and Ringel (2019, pg. 320) explain their study on comparing the use of R and SPSS software in introductory statistics courses.\nAs you read through the abstract, consider and select which strategy you think best fits their rationale. After selecting the type of rationale you think best fits, check the explain the answer box to see why we placed it there.\n\n“Professors of courses without lab components, and/or courses in which students have high levels of statistics anxiety and diverse mathematical and computational backgrounds, may be left wondering whether it is worthwhile to introduce students to R over other software types. Indeed, ongoing debates in online education communities suggest that the use of R with undergraduates, and how the experience compares to teaching software such as SPSS, is very much an open question that many educators would like to see answered empirically (e.g., see https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_it_easier_for_students_to_learn_statistics_using_SPSS_or_R). Statistics professors have likewise written blogs about the benefits and drawbacks of R and SPSS (e.g., Anglim, 2013; Franklin, 2018; Wall, 2014). These debates capture the concern that R is a highly useful program for students but comes with a steeper learning curve and fewer resources available for beginners compared to other software, leading instructors to question whether it is wise to emphasize R in an introductory course (especially those for non-statistics majors). To the best of our knowledge, no study has explicitly compared the teaching of R to statistical software more commonly used with undergraduates, such as SPSS. Moreover, there is little research on incorporating statistical output in the introductory classroom, much less whether one type of output is more advantageous than another.”\n\n\nWhat is the most fitting type of rationale?\n\nExploring an under researched topic.Direct replication of a previous study.Conceptual replication of a previous study.Addressing limitations in the method of a previous study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain this answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key details are in the final two sentences to explain they are not aware of past research comparing the software and they want to explore this under researched topic. Previously, Rode and Ringel discussed statistics anxiety and the use of different software to teach introductory statistics courses. However, they were not aware of previous studies that compared software and investigated whether one was better than the other.\n\n\n\n\n13.2.10 How does this apply to my stage one group report?\nNow you have read different strategies and worked through activities to identify potential arguments for the rationale, you can think in your group what your line of argument will be. As you conduct your literature review for the introduction, you will start to develop a sense of what research is out there on your topic and what research is missing.\nFor example, there might be research on test anxiety and self-efficacy in isolation, but maybe there are seemingly no studies looking at the direct relationship between them. You might find lots of research looking at the relationship between intrinsic motivation and age in undergraduate students, but maybe there are no studies on postgraduates. There is one key study comparing meta-cognitive self-regulation in undergraduates and postgraduates, but it has not been independently directly replicated.\nThe strategies for the rationale above was not an exhaustive list, so do not worry if your rationale does not neatly fit into one of these categories. There is not one correct approach as it will depend on how you present the literature review and work towards the gap you identified in past research. By the end of the introduction, it is just important to clearly communicate and justify your rationale to the reader so they can see your line of argument."

This means we will break down the introduction and method sections for what research has influenced your study and how you designed your study to test your research question.\nThis week, we are focusing on the introduction. This is the first major part of a report and usually one of the longest. The aim of a report introduction is to explain and justify the gap you identified in previous research. Keep the broad to narrow structure in mind. You typically start by providing a focused literature review explaining why the topic is important to study and what previous research and theory is out there. As you move through the introduction, you get more and more specific to guide the reader towards your rationale. The rationale is the purpose of your study, or what gap your study is addressing and why it is important to do so. Finally, the introduction typically ends on your research question and your hypothesis (if applicable).\nAfter a summary of the pre-lab reading chapter, the group element of the lab will focus on discussing where the article you found (see pre-lab tasks) might contribute to your stage one report introduction. Is it more background research or theory, or could it contribute as a key study towards your rationale? With any remaining time and then outside the lab, you can discuss how your group might structure your introduction and consider roles for writing and editing."
